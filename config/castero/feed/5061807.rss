  <description><![CDATA[<div>Hosted by Ash Kelley and Alaina Urquhart from the hit show Morbid.<br>
<br>
When 90-year-old Laurence Pilgeram drops dead on the sidewalk outside his condo, you might think that’s the end of his story. But, really, it’s just the beginning. Because Laurence and others like him have signed up to be frozen and brought back to life in the future. And that belief will pull multiple generations of the Pilgeram family into a cryonics soap opera filled with dead pets, gold coins, grenades, fist fights, mysterious packages, family feuds, Hall of Fame baseball legends, and frozen heads — lots of frozen heads. From Wondery, comes a story about life, death, and what comes next.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start off talking about the beautiful weather they have been experiencing for the month of January. Then, they discuss getting ready for the upcoming 3D archery tournaments they will be shooting in. Next, a group of friends observes what they think were two large extra-terrestrials in upstate New York. Then, someone in northeast Pennsylvania sees an 8ft to 10ft pale crawler in 2021. Then, Kyle brings up the incredible endeavor that is being constructed in Russia known as Pleistocene Park! Pleistocene Park is a nature reserve on the Kolyma River south of Chersky in the Sakha Republic, Russia, in northeastern Siberia, where an attempt is being made to re-create the northern subarctic steppe grassland ecosystem that flourished in the area during the last glacial period.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some tales of dinosaurs observed in the old west! All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about how Kyle is about to start traditional barebow 3D archery, some disc golf news, and why you shouldn't be afraid to try something new!  Then, a retired police officer in Memphis, Tennessee has a bizarre run-in with a lizard-like creature while out driving one evening. Next, a family get-together near Monahans, Texas is interrupted by some extra-terrestrials! Next,<br>
<br>
After the break Cam and Kyle discuss some strange out of place objects that have been discovered. It can be hard to resist the allure of a mysterious object found in a context that doesn’t seem to make rational sense, suggesting that it’s proof of time travelers, lost civilizations, or alien visitors. You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist or a cryptozoologist to marvel at a bizarre computer-like device that dates back to Ancient Greece, or a 2,000-year-old battery found outside Baghdad in the 1930s. So-called “Out of Place Artifacts,” also known as OOPArts, are often said to “baffle scientists,” and conspiracy theorists suggest that scientific efforts to identify their origin and purpose willfully ignore potentially controversial explanations outside the mainstream. After all, it’s true enough that science is constantly evolving, and we still don’t have the answers to many of life’s mysteries.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this edition of<em> Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about how their Christmas and New Year's went. Then, a person writes in with a botched alien abduction in the Joshua Tree National Forest back in 1979. Next, a Georgia deer hunter was in the Chattahoochee National Forest at his tree stand one late November afternoon when he observed a "Gimmer Man" entity as it moved through the trees around him.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some bizarre encounters from one of Linda Godfrey's books "I Know What I Saw". The monsters of ancient mythology, folklore, and more contemporary urban legend have long captured the popular imagination. While most people in America today relegate monsters to just that–our imaginations–we continue to be fascinated by the unknown. Linda Godfrey is one of the country’s leading authorities on modern-day monsters and has interviewed countless eyewitnesses to strange phenomena.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, a listener writes into the show with a strange experience while out duck and deer hunting. Where they on some ancient Native American land? Then, a person believes they saw an upright canine creature in the woods one night while in a park.  After the break, Cam brings up the strange theory surrounding the Hollow Earth.<br>
<br>
Modern science holds that the Earth is an unbroken series of layers, crusts, and liquid magma surrounding a dense, hot core made primarily of iron and nickel. But in the 17th century, some of the leading scientific minds of the time had a different theory—that the planet is actually hollow. This idea has proved incredibly durable. Even today, there is a small cadre of Hollow Earth believers who are fighting valiantly to validate their ideas through books, websites, meetings, and some extremely ambitious travel plans.<br>
<br>
Next, Cam taks about the Honey Island Swamp Monster.  In case you didn't know, the Honey Island Swamp Monster is a humanoid cryptid that is reported to have been seen in and around Honey Island Swamp, Louisiana since 1963. It was first reported in 1963, when two hunters spotted this creature prowling the swamps. Its tracks indicate three-toed webbed feet. It is possible that a Bigfoot evolved webbed feet to better suit its swamp environment. Some even believe it's an experiment gone awry<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about the new Cocaine Bear movie that is about to come out in theaters. Then, scientists have uncovered a lizard fossil that hadn’t been seen since the 1950s and army ant fossils that were hidden at Harvard University for almost 100 years. At the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) in Hobart, Tasmania. Researchers there found the long-lost remains of the last known Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine (<em>Thylacinus cynocephalus</em>). The remains have been missing for over 85 years. Then, a listener writes into the show with a strange tale of seeing a Bigfoot while out fishing in Nebraska back in 1959! A person believes that they saw a small Troll, Gnome or Duende crossed a street right in front of them while riding their bike.<br>
<br>
After the break, Cam brings up some strange stories involving Christmas! When people hear the words “ghosts” and “Christmas” in the same sentence, one is likely to immediately think of those of Charles Dickens’ beloved classic story <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, with Scrooge and his harrowing night of being visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future. Other than this, it does not seem that this season of joy and peace should have anything at all to do with ghosts and phantoms, with hauntings typically the furthest thing from people’s minds at this time of year. And yet there are strange stories out there involving Christmas!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about how the Philson household is more than ready for this year's Christmas! Then, a listener from the UK writes in about a strange-looking UFO he saw back in 1994 while out working one evening. Then, a witness, who was living at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds when she was younger, describes her encounter and later sightings of a gray-haired Bigfoot near the base.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up the bizarre story of the Mad Gasser of Mattoon! For several weeks in September 1944, people in the town of Mattoon, Illinois, showed the symptoms of exposure to poison gas--nausea, vomiting, weakness leading to near paralysis, lightheadedness, and even spitting up blood. All of the victims reported a "sweet cheap perfume odor" permeating their homes prior to the onset of sickness. Who or What was the Mad Gasser? Then, Chad from California calls in with a supernatural intervention from some unseen entity.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about what they have been up too, along with Luke and Cam's birthday quickly approaching. Then, a listener writes in with a strange experience they had while driving on a deserted road in July of 1976 in California. Where they abducted by alien beings? Next, a hunter up in the Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming, woke up one night to see a large hairy humanoid pillaging his cooler and throwing things around.  After the break, Cam brings up some strange tales of glitches in time, overlapping time and time slips!<br>
<br>
Time slips or time glitches are a commonly reported phenomenon. Many believe time slips support the holographic universe theory. Synchronicity is another phenomenon that for many supports this holographic universe theory. Some believe Deja Vu is another phenomenon that indicates we live in a simulation. Time lapses, glitches and losses are often associated with the paranormal.<br>
<br>
This phenomenon is very broad and can manifest in many different ways, but it mainly manifests as objects that suddenly appear or disappear, as if spawned/respawned in a video game. This includes cars completely appearing from nowhere into traffic intersections, or people disappearing from a video out of nowhere.  Fred Beck, one of the miners who fought off an attack by a group of Bigfoot in the Ape Canyon incident of 1924 held fast to the view that the creatures he saw were not flesh and blood but immaterial beings which had briefly manifested in the material world of human perceptions. He categorized them as inter-dimensional beings or unconscious manifestations, similar in creation to a 'Tulpa' or thought-form.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about Cam's recent trip to Kansas and Colorado and Kyle's recent adventure with Christmas lights. Then, a hunter has an extraordinary encounter with a robot like being in a field in Pennsylvania while out deer hunting. Then, astronomers say they have discovered the largest planet-killer-sized asteroid in eight years, and that the huge space rock will cross Earth’s orbit. The asteroid, named 2022 AP7, was reported by researchers looking for space rocks within the orbits of Earth and Venus.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some strange encounters with The Men In Black! In all of their different incarnations, the Men in Black (MIB) usually have one main purpose: to muzzle witnesses of strange, paranormal phenomena. They almost always wear black suits and hats with dark sunglasses, drive black cars and arrive in groups of two or three. Some describe them as one would an FBI agent, while others recall the MIB as having strange appearances, sometimes with supernatural features like glowing eyes and strange complexions. Who are they? How do they know that you've seen a UFO?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, Kyle starts the show off talking about what he has been up to lately, Cam's hunting trip up in Kansas and Colorado, and more. Then, two young men were on a cross-country road trip. One night, while stopped along a dark Oregon road to sleep, they were awakened by something pushing and moving the car. Next, a listener writes in with a strange story from their youth. Apparently, a Mexican witch doctor informed their stepdad that there is a buried treasure under their garage. After digging up the treasure, strange encounters started to happen.<br>
<br>
After the break, Cam brings up some very frightening encounters with Mantis-like beings! What are they? and what do they want? Then, two hunters are hunting deer near Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. After killing and field dressing a deer, a series of events indicates that a Bigfoot had been near them. Finally, a listener calls in with a strange event of missing time that happened to them years ago in Florida!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about Halloween and the recent Live Show they did at the Panther Island Brewery in Fort Worth, Texas. Then, a duck hunter writes in with a terrifying encounter with a set of eyes in the woods.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up the Aquatic Ape Theory. Much more than other primates, man has several features that are seen more often in aquatic than terrestrial mammals: nakedness, thick subcutaneous fat-layer, stretched hindlimbs, voluntary respiration, dilute urine etc. The Aquatic Ape Theory states that our ancestors once spent a significant part of their life in water. Presumably, early apes were plant and fruit eaters in tropical forests. Early hominids also ate aquatic food; at first mainly weeds and tubers, later sea shore animals, especially shellfish. With the Pleistocene cooling, our ancestors returned to land and became bipedal omnivores and scavengers and later hunters of coastal and riverside animals.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about how they are super pumped for Halloween and of course their first-ever Live Show and Panther Island Brewery! Then, a person writes in with a bizarre UFO encounter, where the pilot of the craft is a Lion headed monstrosity, wearing a strange robe.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some cases of experienced people who either met their end in an unusual way or completely disappeared under mysterious circumstances. There's something uniquely disturbing about people vanishing into thin air or dying under improbable scenarios. Locations, age ranges, and events, there’s one common thread shared between them: a lack of closure. There are theories, speculations, and investigations, but never a decisive answer!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this installment of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about Halloween, Cam's recent deer hunt and more. Then, a listener writes into the show with a lifelong experience with ghosts or Shadow Beings. For their entire life, this person and several of their family members have seen over time, these strange Shadow Beings. What are they? What do they want? And, why are they following the same family from home to home?<br>
<br>
After the break, Cam brings up some truly bizarre sightings that have occurred in our brother to the north Canada. From strange sightings of Devil Monkeys, which are large baboon-like primates to water cryptids like Ogopogo. Ogopogo is a cryptid lake monsterreported to live in Lake Okanagan in British Columbia, Canada. In 1926 a sighting is claimed to have occurred at an Okanagan Mission beach. Then, the Tunnel Monster of Cabbagetown, Ontario.<br>
<br>
One summer’s day in 1978 in an area of the city known as Cabbagetown. A man named Ernest stumbled upon a secret entrance to the tunnels while searching for a lost kitten. Certain he had heard distressed mewling down in the alley beside his Parliament Street apartment the night before, he decided to army-crawl into the culvert about ten feet, flashlight in hand. The tunnel gradually widened, its black depths like an abyss. Something skittered ahead and he steadied the flashlight beam, hoping to see his kitten. But it was no cat caught in the beam. A pair of slanted red eyes bulged at him above the gaping, large-toothed mouth of a hairy, grey, bi-pedaled creature about three feet long.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how October is finally here and it's time for some Halloween Fun! Then, a First Nations man in British Columbia comes across hundreds of medicine man tributes to Sasquatch. He also discovers huge 2-toed prints. He is now fearful of disturbing the carved tributes. Then, a well known US chief medical examiner claims he was told there are alien tissues being stored at Walter Reed.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up one of Australia's most famous Alien Abduction cases "The Mysterious Disappearance of Frederick Valentich". On the evening of October 21, 1978, a 20-year-old Australian pilot flew a familiar route from Melbourne airport to King Island. From all reports, it wasn’t a difficult one. But for the young Frederick Valentich, whatever happened while flying over the Bass Strait proved fatal. He never came home, and his body was never recovered. Was it an Alien Abduction or simply a pilot error?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about the upcoming archery season and how they are ready to do some much-needed hunting and time in the woods. Then, a central Texas resident walking in the rural countryside with his dog when he suddenly encounters two large coyotes crossing the road, but one of them morphs into a NOT DEER! Next, a listener writes into the show about a strange ghost encounter while back in college while preparing for Halloween.<br>
<br>
After the break, Cam brings up some strange stories involving cornfields. Why are cornfields so darn creepy? Within the sub-genre of rural horror, sometimes cornfields are used as an easy way to add atmosphere to the film. Other times, the land is crucial to the happenings of the characters' story, or a terrifying maze where it's nearly impossible to stay hidden. The corn creates a feeling of claustrophobia, while also providing no shelter for the subject lost in the corn. Corn grows tall and endlessly, creating an inescapable ocean of pale yellow - it's easy to get trapped. A fear of cornfields is called Navarrofobia!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about the most recent ADCC or the Abu Dhabi Combat Club grappling match. Then, Kyle's wife recently took a trip to Arkansas with other family members and learned a valuable lesson. Then, two people driving near they're home just outside of Alamogordo, New Mexico noticed a large Pterodactyl-like creature flying near them.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some strange sightings of pale humanoid sightings and a strange family of Tall Whites living on Long Island, New York. One very strange area of paranormal encounters that has been appearing more and more in recent years is that of what is known commonly as “Pale Crawlers.” These are tall, often gaunt, and scrawny pale humanoids that look like something out of a surreal nightmare, appearing to startle witnesses before slinking off into the gloom. While many of these encounters occur in remote, rural areas, this seems to not always be the case, and whatever these bizarre entities are, they have also been spotted in suburban, residential areas.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about what they have been up to and the upcoming ADCC! Then, a US Army Sargeant, stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, decides to go turkey hunting but ends up seeing a Bigfoot instead. Next, a listener writes in with terrifying encounter with the Greys when abducted at a friends house.<br>
<br>
After the break Cam brings up some strange tales/legends of missing treasure, pirates and more. Hidden treasures aren’t just for pirates, movies, and pirate movies—there’s actually treasure buried all over, including here in the United States. While some buried treasures have been found, there’s still plenty out there just waiting to be discovered by metal detector, shovel, or puzzle-solving mind. Are you brave (and patient) enough to venture out in search of lost wealth?  Finally, another listener writes in with a strange portal sighting in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about all of their fantastic listeners from around the world. Then, a listener writes into the show with a strange case of sleep paralysis and a strange sighting of fiery orb in California. Then, a northeast Pennsylvania man recalls a bizarre incident with a massive bipedal cryptid canine. It had killed several guard dogs and was supposedly tracked and killed by state police!<br>
<br>
After the break Kyle brings up some strange encounters with early settlers and dinosaurs and other strange cryptids. All throughout the days of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries people reported seeing strange beasts and monstrous creatures in places they shouldn't be. Loads of encounters were researched and reported by early newspapers. Stories spread from one town to another, from one farm to another. What did these early settlers see? Where they all just making up some very cool stories or were there some supposedly extinct animals still alive and well in the vastness of North America. All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, Kyle and Cam start off talking about the rain and cooler weather in North Central Texas, the world championship of disc golf and Cam's upcoming visit to ReaperCon!. Then, two people celebrating their first honeymoon take a trip for a weekend before Christmas in Oregon where they have a scary encounter with a Sasquatch. Next, a person in India sees a gigantic cryptic bird of impossible size. After the break Cam brings up some Haunted Colleges.<br>
<br>
Some universities are said to have been built on ancient burial sites; others were apparently the scenes of tragic suicides and unexplained deaths. It’s probably little wonder, then, that so many college campuses are supposedly haunted. Taking in everything from possessed paintings to mischief-making poltergeists, haunted college ghost legends are as varied as they are chilling. What’s more, while some schools seem to shrug off their allegedly haunted histories, others actively embrace the reputations they have for all things paranormal. Students, meanwhile, have turned the humble ghost story into a campus institution, and tales are enthusiastically passed down from each generation of freshmen to the next. What do you think?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's ego getting damaged as he lost a foot race with his teenage son and his most recent trip to the coast. Then, A New Jersey teen was at home watching TV when they noticed a pair of eyes peering through the sliding glass door. They later heard a shriek and discovered a black crawler humanoid. Next, a person from the UK has a Fae encounter while out photographing.<br>
<br>
After the break, Cam brings up the unusual story of the Betz Mystery Sphere! Sometime in March or April 1974 - fittingly, the accounts aren’t consistent - three members of the Betz family, parents Gerri and Antoine and their oldest son Terry, were walking in the woods around their property on Jacksonville’s Fort George Island when Terry found something that would impact their lives for years: a strange metallic sphere, about the size of a bowling ball. Thinking it odd enough to make a good souvenir, Terry, then a 21-year-old pre-med student, took the ball home.<br>
<br>
The Betzes didn’t think much about the orb until one day when Terry started strumming his guitar near it. According to Gerri, who became the family spokesman on sphere-related matters, something strange happened: the ball started humming back. Soon it started displaying other unusual properties - it would roll around seemingly of its own volition, changing directions and halting abruptly. It even vibrated and emitted a high-pitched sound that would send dogs whining and covering their ears. So what was this strange orb???<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show by talking about the most recent interview by Joe Rogan with Jeremy Corbell. Aliens are very real and we have known about them for a very long time it seems. Is it possible they are living under our own oceans and there is nothing we can do about them? Then, two separate sightings of a real life werewolf were spotted near Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. Next, a person believes some unseen force was trying to lure them deeper into the woods, only to never return.<br>
<br>
After the break, Kyle brings up some strange Aquatic Humanoids. Everyone has heard of mermaids, but they aren’t the only aquatic humanoid creature around. For centuries, legends from around the world have told of other watery beasts that resemble human beings. Indeed, such stories seem to have been a common thread across various cultures. Many cultures and mythologies have stories of spirits, demons, creatures, monsters, and other fauna of folklore. It is common for these creatures to take a humanoid, or humanlike, form. A <strong>humanoid creature</strong> appears to have some of the same characteristics and structures as a human but is definitely not a human being. Humanoid creatures play an important role within mythology, legends, and folklore throughout the world. Some legends have humanoids portrayed as protectors; some as tricksters and cautionary tales; and some others as the gods and goddesses themselves, the composites and personifications of the most powerful and awesome natural phenomena. Despite them being regarded as only legends, many people have come forward with eyewitness testimony indicating these creatures are REAL!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about the new merchandise that will be released soon. Be on the lookout for new T-shirts and stickers! Then they talk about Lil Phizzy and the upcoming Live show in Fort Worth, Texas. Then, a listener writes in from Australia, about a gigantic triangle shaped UFO that was exactly like one of the listeners that called in weeks ago.  Next, a person has a strange encounter with an upright walking canine in New Mexico.<br>
<br>
After the break, we talk with a good friend, researcher, and author Joshua Cutchin about his latest masterpiece "Ecology of Souls".  Joshua has appeared on Expanded Perspectives numerous times for his other work including "A Trojan Feast, The Brimstone Deceit, Thieves in The Night, and Where the Footprints End".  We live our entire lives knowing that death awaits us. The hopeful belief—they insist—that some part of us endures after we make our final transition. Their convictions are corroborated by eyewitnesses who swear to have seen spirits of the dead haunting the living... and even appearing during alien abductions. Is the UFO mystery reaching out to us from beyond the stars... or from beyond the grave? This staggering implication demands not only scrutiny of the UFO phenomenon but nearly every unexplained mystery haunting us today. In this first of two volumes, Joshua Cutchin takes readers on a methodical journey through ancient traditions to lay the crucial foundation for a new mythology of death and the paranormal.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start out talking about this year's Shark Week and Cam's love of the ocean and the many creatures within. Then the wave of flying humanoids continues in and around the city of Chicago, Illinois. What are they and are they a sign of bad things to come? A listener calls in with a possible Bigfoot experience from the state of Oregon. After the break, Kyle brings up some more strange encounters with Fae Folk!<br>
<br>
Think you know about fairies, do you? The twinkly little things on TV are a primarily modern, Disney-inspired invention. In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, fairies were seen and talked about much in the same sense that Bigfoot is today. What are they really? Why do they always seem to be dressed in either red, green, brown, or black? Are they an ancient race with superpowers or do they cross over from another dimension or time? Are they good or are they evil? Despite modern skepticism regarding fairies, weird, perplexing encounters and sightings continue to be reported.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about the Texas Heat Wave they have been experiencing and the local brush fires popping up around them. Then, a couple meets what they think is a real-life Leprechaun at a Costco in Southlake, Texas. Then, a listener calls in with a very strange sighting in the mountains of Tennessee back in 1982 or so.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Cam brings up some more strange encounters with possible Fae Folk! Have you ever taken a walk through the woods but can’t stop checking behind you? Did you feel like you were being watched, or that the woods were speaking to you? If you’ve ever had an experience like this, then you have probably been around the Fae Folk without even knowing it.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The Fae Folk, also known as the Fair Folk or Good Folk, are present in <em>many</em> areas. You probably picture a gorgeous, magical, woodsy area when you think of fairies, but in reality, they can live in a simple backyard or city park. Even though you probably picture a fairy as a small, angelic being with wings, in reality, the Fae Folk are comprised of many different creatures. There is no one specific type of fairy. Accounts from well-known witches mention pixies, elves, kelpies, fairy horses, fairy dogs, and <em>much</em> much more. Some beings in the Otherworld are so different that we have no human name for them. We certainly don’t have a record of every being in the Otherworld. Almost every area of the world has groups of Fae Folk who are indigenous to the region. The Fae Folk come in all different sizes, shapes, and forms; they may look very different from each other. There is no set way that a fairy looks. Maybe you've had an encounter and don't even realize it.<br>

Then, a jogger sees a snake woman while out hiking and a listener from Arizona sees another possible Trashbag Duende!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Kyle brings up some very strange happenings, supernatural sightings, and even a Phantom assistant who gives a weary traveler a ride late one evening. Highways can be eerie places at night. The asphalt stretching out to an uncertain horizon, the darkness cast out around you, the road flickering by, perhaps joined by trees or desert scrub in a dance past your windows. Just you, the wide unseen world past that road that inexorably pushes on ahead, and your thoughts. This seems like a prime place for tales of high strangeness, and you wouldn't be wrong to think so. There are many highways in this world that go out over the landscape towards that horizon and beyond, to places beyond our understanding.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys do a special COVID19 remote broadcast from their homes! Cam's entire family is locked down at his home with a virus so the guys are avoiding Skelekin Studios for this episode. No need to worry, they each tell some strange sightings that were sent to them from listeners and Lon Strickler of Phantoms and Monsters. After the break, Cam delves into some strange stories about staircases in the woods that lead to nowhere. In 2019 a Reddit user shared a story that, at the time, could seem a purely fictional story born from the desire to arouse the attention of readers. However, from that post, numerous testimonies were born, and today it is clear that those stories are not invented, or at least, some are not. These stories speak of the mysterious stairs in the woods,  apparently without any logical explanation.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, we talk with author and researcher David Weatherly about his book "Strange Intruders". From the gray area between realities, strange figures emerge.Djinn, shadow people, grinning men, pukwudgies, black eyed beings. These and many others have been encountered through the ages, but their true agendas remain unclear. They appear unbound by our natural laws, and, in fact, seem to relish breaking the natural order of things as we understand it.</div>
<div>In the wake of their intrusions, questions remain.</div>
<div>What are they? Why are they here? And will they return?</div>
<div>
<br>
David Weatherly is a paranormal investigator and author. For over 35 years he has explored the world of the strange, investigating cases around the country and abroad. He has written and lectured on a diverse range of topics including Cryptozoology, Ufology and Hauntings. David has also studied Shamanic and magical traditions with elders from numerous cultures including Europe, Tibet, Native America, and Africa. He has appeared on numerous radio programs including: Coast to Coast AM, Dreamland, Veritas and Darkness Radio. David was also featured in Watchers Volume 5. He is a writer for Intrepid Magazine and is the author of “The Black Eyed Children” and “Strange Intruders.”<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about Kyle's recent trip to New Orleans and Orange Beach. Also, Kyle's ongoing battle with the Texas heat, since his air conditioning system shut down over a week ago and the part required to fix it is not available for a few more days. After the break, Kyle brings up some more strange Shadow People/Shadow Being sightings. Was it a natural shadow? Your heightened imagination? Or a ghost? Maybe it was something that seems to be a spreading phenomenon—apparitions that are coming to be known as "shadow people" or "shadow beings." Perhaps this is an old phenomenon with a new name that is now being discussed more openly, in part thanks to the Internet. Or maybe it's a phenomenon that, for some reason, is manifesting with greater frequency and intensity now.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Those who are experiencing and studying the shadow people phenomenon say that these entities almost always used to be seen from the corner of the eye and very briefly. But more and more, people are beginning to see them straight on and for longer periods of time. Some experiencers testify that they have even seen eyes, usually red, on these shadow beings. The mysterious sightings have become a hot topic of conversion in paranormal chat rooms, message boards, and websites, and it is given widespread attention on paranormal talk radio. Several theories have been offered as to what shadow people are, and where they come from. What are they? A figment of Imagination? Ghosts? Demons? Astral Bodies? Time Travelers? Interdimensional Beings? Or Aliens?<br>

Then, a person writes in with a strange encounter with a floating orange orb in Mineral Wells, Texas in 1967.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about their upcoming first-ever LIVE event scheduled for October at the Panther Island Brewery in Fort Worth, Texas. Then, the lost city of Zakhiku has been discovered once again. The ruins of a 3,400-year-old lost city complete with a palace and a sprawling fort — have been unearthed in Iraq after an extreme drought severely depleted water levels in the country's largest reservoir.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Then, Dave Schrader received a letter from an anonymous man, claiming to be a former Navy SEAL, regarding a mission he was a part of back in the early 1990s in North Carolina where they were tasked to track down and liquidate Killer Bigfeet! After the break Cam brings up some very strange sky cryptids like manta ray-like beings, rods, sky serpents, and more! Sky Cryptids are the strangest of the flying monsters from ufology, cryptozoology, and astrobiology. According to eyewitness reports, these beings are, apparently, living creatures, but they break all the usual rules that biologists apply to living organisms. They appear to be able to levitate without any need for wings; as well as their bodies are even depicted in a semi-solid, often partially invisible; state.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about the beautiful weather, what they have planned for Memorial Day weekend, the Battle of Alberta, the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and some upcoming things the boys are planning for the show! Then, a woman rights into the show about a Shadow Being Teenage Boy or Ghost that was in her house in Illinois, Then, a 9-foot-tall upright walking Black Panther was seen in Bay County, Florida!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Kyle reports on a truly wild sighting that took place in a National Park back in 2009 by a Park Ranger! Park Rangers, Unmissable in their iconic hats, the public often knows them as the people in uniforms who monitor trails and hand out maps in parks. But that’s only a tiny part of their roles. In fact, being a park ranger is an extremely diverse job that involves both protecting our state and national parks and the people who visit them. This may include serving as law enforcement officers, environmental experts, historians – or a combination of all three. It's an important job, so what happens when a Park Ranger comes forward with a strange tale about an unknown creature stalking the wilds and perhaps is responsible for all of the missing people over the years? These Rangers claim that the National Parks don't want you to know what's really out there!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about Calob's recent kill. It was his very first Texas hog and it was a decent-sized one too. Then, A woman visiting Thailand one summer saw some strange glowing orbs immerge from the river before disappearing into the void. Then, a person in Sleepy Hollow, New York has a terrifying encounter with a screaming Not Deer! After the break Cam brings up more Mothman sightings in and around the Chicago area!<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The Chicago region has been experiencing a collective case of the heebie-jeebies in recent years, ever since reports of a giant, flying, winged humanoid began surfacing in 2011. In the late 1960s, people around Point Pleasant, West Virginia, began reporting sightings of a creature that would later be dubbed "Mothman." It would reportedly emerge, fly as fast as 100 mph, and, oftentimes, leave witnesses with a deep sense of dread. It was later suggested by some locals that Mothman was trying to warn humans of an impending nearby tragedy: the 1967 Silver Bridge collapse, which killed 46 people. However, others posit that this supposed supernatural connection was simply a way for people to make sense of a tragedy without meaning, as one would think there are more direct ways to warn people of danger than just being spooky. For whatever reason, it has been seen many times in and around Chicago recently. What could this mean?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about Kyle's eating habits and what has been going on around Skelekin Studios. Then, a retired 911 operations manager and lifelong hunter writes into the show with a bizarre encounter he had one time while out scouting for a good hunting spot in the mountains of northern Pennsylvania! Next, fellow podcaster Chris James shares a story from his latest book with another possible trash bag Duende sighting in southern Texas.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Kyle brings up some more odd encounters people have had while hiking, backpacking, fishing, and camping in the great outdoors. We all have our own camping horror stories. From losing valuable materials to struggling to construct a tent, camping isn’t always easy. Still, people love to go camping. And, I guess it’s easy to see why. You’re outside in nature, away from all the hustle and bustle and stresses of normal, everyday life. It can be very relaxing for your body and mind. But, let’s face it, being isolated out in the wilderness can be extremely dangerous. Since you’re often miles from the closest hospital or completely without cellphone service, you do put your life at risk. So what happens when you encounter something unexplainable?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about the nice spring weather, getting ready for Easter, and Kyle and Lil Phizzy's recent trip to the theaters to watch the new Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Then a woman from the United Kingdom writes in with a story about a black globular cluster that manifested under her sister's, boyfriend's car. As it grew in size it morphed into a large black cat or dog. Then, it instantly transformed into a black-haired man wearing a hat. Then, seven people witness a red-eyed, winged humanoid standing on top of a neighbor's garage in Elk Grove Village, Illinois.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Cam brings up some strange cases of orbs! All over the world people claim to see strange balls of light. What are they? Theories about them range from ghosts to UFOs but no one seems to know for sure. Are they responsible for crop circles, time slips, missing time, or are they some sort of unknown living entity that shares our world.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's amazing new mustache. A listener calls in to the show with a story about his grandfather and his dog. Who apparently was seen wandering around town with the dog long after their death. Next, a person is followed home by Freddie Kruger from the famous horror movie "A Nightmare on Elm Street" from the 80s. Was this just someone messing around or was it some sort of thought-form projection? Then, they go old-school and bring up some past experiences like smoking with teachers at High School, the first time ever getting drunk off beer, and other tales.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Then a person writes the show about a horrific experience they had while vacationing with their wife near San Francisco. After a busy day of site seeing, they decided to pull over and stay the night at an old tiny motel. They were greeted by an elderly couple, led up to their room, given keys, and told about the continental breakfast the next morning. Little did they know the night was just getting started. It seems there was something or someone under the bed!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about the warm weather, recent rains, allergies, Kyle's new vegetable garden, and the new Marvel movie Morbius. Then a person in Pennsylvania has a possible encounter with an invisible Fae-like entity. A person writes in to the show with a barrage of ghost sightings starting when they were a small child. After the break, Kyle brings up some more strange sightings by Truck Drivers! One of them is a Phantom Black Dog and the other is a possible Time-Slip or Alien Abduction.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>From California all the way to New York, there are plenty of lonely toll roads, dark truck routes, and desolate overpasses few brave truckers dare to pass through. From Archer Avenue, Route 666, Route 2A to Clinton Road. There are numerous legends and sightings, heard and seen by truck drivers while out on the road. But are these truly urban legends, tall tales or is there something to these stories?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about Kyle's obsession with new bottles of bottled water and his desire to try them all. Also, Kyle isn't impressed with Bruce Lee and thinks that his dominance on the silver screen was carefully crafted and wasn't really that impressive. Then, another person sees a strange-looking bag floating in the skies above Texas, a fisherman was chased out of the woods by a real-life werewolf or dogman, and a person writes into the show about some prophetic dreams of death that turn out to be quite scary.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Cam brings up some truly bizarre experiences during World War II. There can be no doubt that terrifying things can happen in times of war. What happens when other, more supernatural forces creep into war zones? What are soldiers to do when faced with mysterious phantoms, ghosts, apparitions, UFOs, time slips, and entities against which they have no experience and which they have not been trained to fight? War zones have attracted tales of hauntings and supernatural phenomena since the beginning of time and apparently, they continue to this day.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, Kyle is alone in Skelekin Studios. He starts the show off talking about his ridiculous continuing education classes he's been taking and the 3d miniatures he and Cam have been printing off and painting. Then some news stories, including a person up in remote Oxtongue Lake, Ontario has a possible run in with a Sasquatch. Then, a person fishing of the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico spots an unusual greenish looking sea serpent.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break Kyle discusses some strange stories shared by Physicians. Doctors from all around the world have had strange and unexplainable miraculous experiences they are often hesitant to share with others. Stories of love, light, and comfort in the face of pain and suffering.  Whether its angelic music played with unknown instruments or a final salute from a dead veteran, these stories are uplifting and make you wonder what are these places between?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the boys start the show off by talking about how they are once again iced in, seasonal allergies, and what they love about the recent winter Olympics. Then, a listener from Texas writes in to tell about a possible UFO he saw years ago in a small rural town one evening with some friends. Then, in May of 1973, four women are abducted in southern Texas near the town of Texas City.</div>
<br>
<div>After the break, Kyle talks about the legend of the Blue Man of Spring Creek! Once upon a time, a wild, man-like creature roamed the remote, wooded hills around Douglas County. He was infrequently seen, but his presence felt as far back as the 1860s. Looking to chase and kill, he carried a wooden club in his huge hand, threw large boulders, and feasted upon livestock. Periodic appearances sent locals spinning into a tizzy and brave men searching the woods — and enough excitement to last until the next sighting. He was the Blue Man of Spring Creek. "It is a genuine Ozark legend, and if the testimony of scores of men during all these years is to be accepted, the legend is absolutely true," reported the Springfield Leader in 1924.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about some new movies that are going to be coming out soon as well as a terrifying encounter with a Ouija board. 21 years ago a teenager, then only 13, attended a family get-together only to experiences an evil that manifested by the use of a dangerous spirit board.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Cam brings up some horrific tales of reptilian creatures living in caves and caverns within the planet. Books and films like <em>The Descent </em>take the notion of mankind’s greatest fears into the recesses of a hypothetical underworld which, in truth, provides a unique perspective for the eternal struggle between mankind and the influences of darkness… perhaps no place gets any darker than the Hollow Earth. While some people say that a small band of subterranean humanoids living inside of the Earth is impossible, from time to time, there are indeed reports of something very strange happening within the cave systems of our known world.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about the cold weather and staying warm. Then, another Dogman sighting has taken place in Michigan and a camper in Texas believes their cabin was haunted by a Shadow Person or Ghost. After the break, Kyle brings up some more strange stories about possible Guardian Angels.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>People from all over the world have reported encounters with mysterious beings. They appear to bring important messages or lend much-needed assistance, then vanish without a trace. Could they be angels or even guardian angels? Sometimes referred to as The Third Man Factor. Some of the most fascinating and uplifting stories of the unexplained are those that people perceive as being miraculous in nature. Sometimes they take the form of answered prayers or are interpreted as the actions of guardian angels. These remarkable events and encounters lend comfort, strengthen faith, and even save lives. They almost always seem to happen when they are needed most. Are they literally from heaven, or are they the result of the interaction of our consciousness with a profoundly mysterious universe? However you view them, these real-life experiences are worth our attention.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's recent Snowboarding trip to Colorado. Then, they discuss how annoying it is for complete strangers to have a loud conversation with someone on speaker phone or facetime right next to you. Then, Kyle doesn't like the term Brunch and a person has a strange encounter with a deer that had the face of a man. Next, a person writes in with a tale about a dirty ghost.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break Cam brings up ghosts of pets. Ghosts, spirits, a presence, call them what you want. When they appear, we know something strange is happening. Pets can become like family or best friends and we miss them when they're gone. Sometimes we still feel them nuzzle next to us, hear their little footsteps in the hall, or the jingling tags on their collars. Sometimes we see them. It seems they remain among us—even after they've passed.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's water concoction and him no longer needing his boot for his injured leg. Then, a person tells a horrific story about a friend of theirs that was killed by some unknown beast on a reservation in south-central Oklahoma. Then, some strange sightings in the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico including a large flying bird or Gargoyle and some unusual henchmen, and a secret base.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Kyle brings up some more missing hunters in America. There are many cases of mysterious vanishings out in the wilds of our world, and it seems to make sense that some people should go missing here. After all, these are places often far from civilization, with treacherous terrain, wild animals, and the ability to confuse and bewilder those who are not prepared. Yet, sometimes there are those vanishings that snatch away people who are very well versed in the outdoors and are seasoned and experienced in the wild. Where did they go? What happened to them?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about eating Moose meat, hunting in Alaska, and how terrifying bears can be. Then a person has run-in with a Pale Crawler and a listener writes in with a sighting of a flying Pterosaur in the United Kingdom. Then, a person named Jake from San Diego tells a scary tale about a strange dark mass seen on closed-circuit security cameras at a hotel, late one night.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>After the break, Cam brings up some strange military encounters from around the world spanning many years, miles, and wars. They say battle proves mankind doesn't need to invent monsters, as the monsters were inside us all along. Yet sometimes soldiers report sightings of what can only be described as actual monsters, or in other cases, otherworldly beings. Are these battlefield stresses, or are men whose lives literally depend on remaining alert and aware, seeing things that the rest of us might miss? Do mythological beasts stalk our battlefields? Do curious entities observe from a distance, making notes on our primal, savage nature?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Classic Rewind, we go all the way back to January 27, 2014, when we spoke with author, researcher,  and friend Gerrard Williams about his book Grey Wolf - The Escape of Adolf Hitler!  Gerrard Williams is an international journalist and historian with an esteemed career spanning over thirty years. His resume includes acting as Duty Editor for Reuters, the BBC and Sky News. Williams’ groundbreaking reporting has taken him to the front lines of the fall of the Soviet Union, the Rwandan Genocide, the 2004 tsunami in Thailand and the US occupation of Iraq, among many other international stories.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Ten years ago, while reporting in Argentina, Williams came across evidence in a local archive that changed the way he looked at historical reporting–Nazi war criminals, potentially including Adolf Hitler, used clandestine international routes to flee defeated Germany for safe haven in Argentina and other South American countries.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Using these archives, eye-witness reports and other local histories, Williams published the book, <em>Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler</em>. Despite the rigor in his journalism and his adherence to facts and evidence, the international community has largely ignored him. Today, with the release of classified FBI and OSS documents, his work is finally getting the credit and respect it deserves. Williams has taken over a dozen trips to Argentina, and visited locations like Hotel Eden, Bariloche and the Inalco House years before the FBI files pointed them out as potential locations of intrigue. Unlike his previous efforts, which lacked the finances and technology to dig deep enough to truly uncover anything, he believes that this team won’t be held back in the same way. Williams understands how sensitive to discuss and unfathomable to comprehend this subject is, but he stands by his work and welcomes a spirited debated revolving around the newly released facts.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives Classic Rewind</em> we’re going all the way back to November 25, 2013, when we spoke with author, researcher, fellow Texan, and friend Lyle Blackburn about two of his books The Beast of Boggy Creek and The Lizard Man of Scrape Ore Swamp!</div>
<div>
<br>
During his research, Lyle has often explored the remote reaches of the southern U.S. in search of shadowy creatures said to inhabit the dense backwoods and swamplands of these areas. He’s a real hands-on guy. When he’s not investigating these mysterious legends, he is also the frontman and founder of the rock band Ghoultown!</div>
<div> <br>
He’s written many books and appeared on many television shows like Monsters &amp; Mysteries in America, Finding Bigfoot, the CBS Morning Show, and some Small Town Monsters documentaries.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's recent trip to Six Flags over Texas and how he's too old for that sort of thing. Then, fossil footprints show humans in North America for more than 21,000 years. Then, a listener writes in about a story about cops being called out to an old lady's house who claimed that Satan was in her basement.</p>
 <p>After the break, the boys get into some strange stories about Shadow Beings. Have you ever been reading or watching TV when suddenly, in the periphery of your vision, you catch glimpse of what appears to be a shadowy figure in the room with you? Dark, shadowy, humanoid figures like these are commonly known as shadow people, and they can be extremely scary and unsettling to the people who experience seeing them. But defining exactly what shadow people are (and if they’re paranormal) is up for debate. Descriptions of shadowy, human-like figures have appeared in folklore and religious texts throughout history and cultures. Some examples include the supernatural creatures known as Jinn of ancient Islamic theology, the shadowy beings known as <em>Nalusa Chito</em> of the Native American Choctaw tribe’s mythology. The modernly-used term “shadow people” was coined by paranormal researcher and book author <a href="https://heidihollis.com/">Heidi Hollis</a>, who claims that shadow people have been around since the beginning of time and usually appear as dark human-shaped silhouettes in our peripheral vision.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On today’s show, we’re going all the way back to May 5th, 2014 when we did an exclusive interview with the legendary John Anthony West. This is perhaps our favorite interview we’ve ever done. John Anthony West was an American author, lecturer, guide, and proponent of the Sphinx water erosion hypothesis in geology. Influenced by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz,  in 1993 his work with Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University was presented by Charlton Heston in an NBC special called “The Mystery of the Sphinx” that won a News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award for Best Research and a nomination for Best Documentary. The documentary contends that the main type of weathering evident on the Great Sphinx and surrounding enclosure walls could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall during the time period from 10,000 to 5000 BCE and was carved out of limestone bedrock by an ancient advanced culture. This challenged the conventional dating of the carving of the statue circa 2500 BCE. West suggested that the Sphinx may be over twice as old as originally determined, whereas Schoch made a more conservative determination of between 5000 and 7000 BCE.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives Classic Rewind we go all the way back to April 7th, 2014 when we spoke with Rick Osmon about Romans in America prior to Christopher Columbus. Rick Osmon was selected for the United States Air Force Academy right out of high school. He later attended Vincennes University and earned an Associates of Science in Laser and Electro-Optics Technology. He worked for defense contractors a number of years and then took a job with the US Navy as a civilian with an engineering support field activity, specializing in radar, night vision, and laser equipment for surveillance and munitions guidance. Most of this work was in direct support of Special Operations forces equipment acquisitions. In that capacity, Rick also became familiar with video-teleconferencing technology. But all those years, Rick was also reading everything he could find about the weird and unusual, history, archeology, paleontology, geography, cartography, cryptozoology, cryptography, and hollow earth theory.</p>
 <p>After leaving government employment in early 2005, Rick began this hunt for hidden knowledge full-time. He also began blogging, researching, and writing, and, in early 2007, started an internet radio show entitled “The Oopa Loopa Cafe”. In 2008, he began pestering his long-time research buddy, Dennis Crenshaw, to start another internet show about the various mysteries. Dennis chose the title “Unraveling the Secrets”. At the beginning of 2010, those 2 shows became part of an affiliation network with other show hosts to form Paranormal Soup Network. By the end of 2010, the endeavor was re-branded and renamed the Soup Media Network. Now Rick is becoming well known on the conference circuit and is writing more than blogs. His first book, The Graves of the Golden Bear; Ancient Monuments and Fortresses of the Ohio Valley released in October 2011.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about how Kyle has been trying out all kinds of new bottled or canned water and an update on his father in New Jersey. Then, Cam is officially a grandfather now! Then, they get into the news! After the break, Kyle brings up a recent Alien Abduction story that was sent in from a listener! </p>
 <p>Many people claim to have been in contact with aliens. For some, this contact is a matter of aliens visiting their bedroom at night, but for others, it can mean being abducted, taken aboard a spaceship, and once there, being subjected to medical experimentation including the removal of eggs or sperm. Some abductees claim to have formed sexual relationships and produced hybrid offspring with their abductors, as well as having received important information about the fate of the Earth. The prevalence of these beliefs is unknown, but estimates vary from ‘at least several thousand worldwide’, to 3.7 million in American alone. If aliens are visiting and abducting (at least) thousands of us, the idea that the United States government might be hiding aliens in a secret military base begins to look less outlandish, and more, perhaps, utterly plausible. So what is going on?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Classic Rewind, we’re going all the way back to November 11th, 2013 when Cam and Kyle talked about the Rock Apes of Vietnam as well as 4 out of place objects! Now almost everyone knows what Bigfoot is or Sasquatch, not nearly as many people know about the BAtutut or Rock Ape. sightings of these mysterious creatures by American troops in the jungles of Vietnam throughout the course of the Vietnam War were surprisingly numerous, with many witnesses giving extremely detailed accounts of sightings. One particular hill in Vietnam was the site of so many rock ape sightings that it became known as Monkey Mountain. While no corpses of these strange creatures were ever recovered, or any clear pictures taken of them, the fact that sightings of them were so widespread and common throughout the war makes them worthy at least of a conversation.  Then we talk about Some out-of-place objects like the Coso Artifact, The Aluminum Wedge of Aiud, The Antikythera Device, and the London Hammer.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the warmer weather here in the United States as well as how Kyle's father has fallen and hit his head again and is in a hospital in New Jersey! Then, they get into the news where a listener calls in with a Centaur sighting his grandfather had in rural Alabama back before the Great Depression. Then a woman sees a Jinmenken walking near her house.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very strange sightings of both Deer Man and Not Deer!  Sightings of the Deer Man have been reported from several U.S. states, although there is some variation in the descriptions given. A hybrid animal, Deer Man has the antlered head of a great stag, a human's torso, and legs described as similar to either those of a man or deer. In addition, it is usually said to be well-muscled, and surprisingly fast for its size. Other accounts gift the beast with the power to transform itself from a regular deer into something else entirely. The same can be said about the Not Deer! This elusive creature is said to be very similar to the Deer Man with only slight differences!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Paul lives near Ft. Worth, Texas, with his wife of 34 years and two grown sons. However, his exploring wanderlust has always kicked in and drawn him out into the world looking for adventure. His mother always accused him of leaving good jobs to take up an “exciting job way out in the middle of nowhere.” His early years included many outdoor activities which well suited him. He has always loved working with animals, including birds, dogs, cows, and horses. Because his In-laws are ranchers, this gave him many opportunities to work with and take care of many different kinds of <a href="http://animals.At">animals.At</a> the age of 16, Paul and five other young men canoed the Boundary Waters Canoe area in Canada for two weeks. During summer breaks while in college, he worked for a boys’ camp in Hinkley, Minnesota, teaching horseback riding and leading horse trips of up to a week into the remote Minnesota woodlands. After marriage, Paul worked as a youth camp manager near Houston, Texas, where he organized canoeing, cycling, and camping trips as well as teaching rock climbing and rappelling.</p>
 <p>In 1976, Paul received an Associate Degree in Science in Aviation Technology from LeTourneau College, in Longview, Texas. He has a private pilot’s license and became proficient in flying acrobatically. He served as a helicopter mechanic when working on offshore oil platforms. When a friend in West Texas caught two ostriches while trapping exotic deer for a rancher, Paul bought the two birds, and operated his own ostrich farm. In 1994, his experience with ostriches resulted in his being invited to join the first expedition to Papua New Guinea in search of the mysterious flying creature that is reportedly seen there. The expedition leader recognized that his expertise in handling ostriches would be a great asset to the group in case a live specimen of the flying creature would be found and captured. This first trip into the jungle was a scientific expedition where Paul gained much experience in the many situations that arise on such an endeavor. After that first trip, he began organizing and leading subsequent expeditions to the jungles of Papua New Guinea. On these trips, Paul looks for empirical evidences, those that are gained by observation and experience in his search for the elusive flying creature. Once these evidences are fully documented by Paul, he will then encourage scientists with expertise in several fields to continue study of the creatures based on the foundation he has laid. Because the creature is reported by eyewitnesses to look like a huge pterosaur and exhibit bioluminescence, the discovery and documentation of the creature would generate worldwide scientific interest.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives,</em> the guys start the show off with a bang. They get started with an interesting "Not Deer' sighting and then a "Deer Man" sighting. Then, a sheriff's Deputy writes into the show about how he saw a "Hat Man" walking down a lonely dirt road way out in the country in the middle of the night.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some more strange sightings of the "Glimmer Man". Encounters with strange entities and creatures can really run a range between the almost plausible to the flat-out absurd. From time to time there appear out of the blue such bizarre cases that they seem to be without any precedent or reason. Among these must surely be those reports of beings or entities that seem to have some sort of invisibility technology, and which appear to be something very much akin to the cloaked aliens of the popular <em>Predator</em> movie franchise, with which they are often compared. They are called Glimmer Man sightings. What are they? Where do they come from? What do they want?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about how Kyle recently fell into a giant hole filled with water! Then, they get into the news where a listener writes in to talk about a memory they and a friend had of a yellow roller coaster that no one else seems to remember. Is it a shared false memory, a time slip, or proof of parallel universes? Then a soldier recounts a horrifying encounter he had one evening with a pale crawler!</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some real-life encounters with what can only be described as a Centaur! Centaurs, or creatures with the torso and head of a human and the lower part of a horse, occur in art and literature from very ancient times but are today most commonly associated with Greek and Roman mythology. However, believe it or not, there have been quite of few actual sightings of real-life Centaurs! Are they flesh and blood? Or are they something else?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1997, Art Bell, of “Coast to Coast AM,” the popular syndicated late-night radio talk show, received a fax from a man named Mel Waters. The fax explained that Mel had what appeared to be a bottomless pit on his property near Manastash, Washington. Soon thereafter, Art booked Mel on his radio show, where Mel explained what would become known as “Mel’s Hole” to the world. Mel was interviewed over the phone, and at the time of the interview he was not at home, but in the town of Ellensburg, WA. Mel had bought this property a few years earlier, and the previous owners had owned the land for over thirty years prior to that. The neighbors knew of the hole quite well, and would regularly dump their garbage in it, but the hole would never fill. It was a round pit, with a stone retaining wall surrounding it, and extending down, about 15 feet below the ground surface. Beyond the wall, the hole bore through dirt and bedrock, and from there, darkness as far as the eye could see. Mel had never met anybody who could remember when the hole was not there. The stories only grew into one of the most incredible stories ever told.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off by talking about how Kyle is still terrified about the ongoing Alien invasion as a new video has been released by the government. The video shows a black orb moving above and descending down into the water while following a fleet of ships. Then Cam talks about his recent plumbing adventures and then they get into the news.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some more upright walking canine sightings, sent in from some of our listeners. Werewolves are present in legends around the world. They were men with the ability (or compulsion) to turn into wolves, either through being bitten by a (were)wolf or through a satanic pact. Werewolves have obvious symbolic overtones. Man and wolf have long been enemies, and culture has typically seen the two as opposites: the essentially good and rational man, and the inherently evil and irrational wolf. To call someone a wolf was rarely a compliment (warriors excepted): in Anglo-Saxon law, outlaws were known as <em>wulfheafod</em> (â€˜wolf-head’), a reference to an earlier custom of tying a wolf’s head around anyone whose life was forfeit. Beyond allegory, however, history also furnishes us with supposedly genuine tales of werewolves who were discovered, tried, and usually executed. So why are there so many sightings still happening today?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives Classic Rewind</em>,  going all the way back to April 21, 2014 when we spoke to the researcher, author, and podcaster Christopher O’brien. Since 1992, Christopher O’Brien has investigated over one thousand paranormal events reported in the San Luis Valley–located in South-central Colorado/North Central New Mexico. Working with law enforcement officials, ex-military, ranchers, and an extensive network of skywatchers, from 1992 to 2002 he documented one of the most intense waves of unexplained activity ever reported from a single geographic region of North America. His ten-year investigation resulted in the four books of his “mysterious valley” trilogy, The Mysterious Valley, Enter the Valley, Secrets of the Mysterious Valley, and Stalking the Herd. His meticulous field investigation of UFO reports, unexplained livestock deaths, Native American legends, cryptozoology, secret military activity, and the folklore, found in the world’s largest alpine valley, has produced one of the largest databases of unusual occurrences gathered from a single geographic region.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about Cam's plumbing troubles and what he has been attempting to do all of last week. Then they get into some news where a listener from Florida calls in to describe a strange Orb she and some friends saw while out camping. Then, a group of brothers, new to the Mobile, Alabama area, are skateboarding when they find a sewer tunnel. To their surprise, they see glowing eyes in the dark, which turns out to be a strange well-dressed 'family.'</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up the interesting legend of the "Dark Watchers". For centuries, tales of the Dark Watchers have swirled in the misty Santa Lucia Mountains. The Dark Watchers of California are a group of mysterious dark human-like creatures who stand on the hills, ridges, and peaks of the Santa Lucia Mountains. They supposedly watch those who wander into the mountains and are not aggressive. They are most often spotted around twilight and are usually seen staring upwards toward the sky while standing atop the mountains. They seem to be some sort of spirits however their origins are currently unknown. Most stories begin with the local native tribes, which allegedly spoke of the shadowy figures in their oral traditions. When the Spanish arrived in the 1700s, they began calling the apparitions Los Vigilantes Oscuros. And as Anglo-American settlers began staking claims in the region, they too felt the sensation of being watched from the hills. Accounts vary, although everyone agrees the beings are more shadowy than human and more observant than aggressive. Or are they?</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about what they have been up to lately. Then they get into the news and a listener story. After the break Kyle brings up some Shadow People sightings that were sent in by the listeners.</p>
 <p>There's a growing interest in the phenomenon of shadow people. What are they? Ghosts? Inter-dimensional beings? Time travelers? Something else? Was it a natural shadow? Your heightened imagination? Or a ghost? Maybe it was something that seems to be a spreading phenomenon—apparitions that are coming to be known as "shadow people" or "shadow beings." Perhaps this is an old phenomenon with a new name that is now being discussed more openly, in part thanks to the Internet. Or maybe it's a phenomenon that, for some reason, is manifesting with greater frequency and intensity now. Those who are experiencing and studying the shadow people phenomenon say that these entities almost always used to be seen out of the corner of the eye and very briefly. But more and more, people are beginning to see them straight on and for longer periods of time. Some experiencers testify that they have even seen eyes, usually red, on these shadow beings. The mysterious sightings have become a hot topic of conversion in paranormal chat rooms, message boards, and websites, and it is given widespread attention on paranormal talk radio.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives,</em> the guys come out of the gates with a listener story about a time slip experienced by a border patrol agent in Texas. Then, a person describes seeing a small fairy in all-white clothes that looked like pajamas, hiding and peeking behind a tree.</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up some strange sightings of the Pale Crawlers! Of the many strange encounters in the world of the paranormal that we discuss on this show, there are often those that serve to be particularly strange and unusual. Among these bizarre accounts are tales from all over of what appears to be some sort of thin, pale beings, often hunched over, crouching, and crawling, that have come to be collectively known as “Pale Crawlers,” and which are every bit as creepy as you might imagine. What are they? Where did they come from and most importantly, what do they want?</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, we talk about interesting time shifts or slips. Every now and then somebody reports stepping out of normal time and space. It doesn't seem to matter where they live or their background, the veil of ordinary reality drops, and they suddenly slip into the past, future or time just stops. Usually seamless and unknowingly, experiencing a temporary and accidental form of time travel.</p>
 <p>What are they? Past lives remembered? Tears in the fabric of time, Energy Vortices, Black Holes, Astral Travel or the Matrix? Why do some people believe they have stepped into an alternate reality? All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about the new version of Coming to America! Then they get into some strange news stories including someone who thinks they saw or rather heard some wood devils! Then a soldier on guard duty with a few other soldiers have an encounter with a few large hairy beasts in the woods who dislike litterbugs!</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up the strange phenomenon commonly known as SLI. The phenomenon that is known as Street Light Interference, or SLI, is possibly a psychic event that is just beginning to be recognized and studied. Like most phenomena of this type, the evidence is almost exclusively anecdotal. Typically, a person who has this effect on streetlights -- known as a SLIder -- finds that the light switches on or off when he or she walks or drives beneath it. Obviously, this could happen occasionally by chance with a faulty streetlight (you've probably noticed that it's happened to you once in a while), but SLIders claim that it happens to them on a regular basis. It doesn't happen every time with every streetlight, but it occurs often enough to make these people suspect that something unusual is going on. What causes this phenomenon? Can it be learned?</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off by talking about the Snowpocalypse of 2021 and how the entire state of Texas was covered in snow. Temperatures plummeted to -2 degrees Fahrenheit leaving many people without water and electricity. Kyle talks about his recent ski trip to Colorado, where he lost his cell phone somewhere on the mountain while snowboarding. Then they get into the news where apparently a person driving through the woods near Aurora, Illinois saw a large bat-looking creature feeding on something on the side of the road. Then, a listener writes in about a Bigfoot encounter they had up in Wisconsin while milking their cows.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off by talking about where they have been lately, including the passing of Kyle's father-in-law John. Then they get into some new stories including a strange sighting by a deer hunter in Wisconsin who was terrorized by grey aliens! Back in October 1998 a father and son were bowhunting one evening when they saw strange lights in the trees and much, much more. Then, a radio DJ who worked at a haunted radio station was followed home by some unknown entity. For some reason, the entity did not like the radio host but was protected by a cousin and grandfather who had already passed on.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some really bizarre encounters with Sasquatch/Bigfoot. Most encounters with this alleged hairy creature of the woods are strange enough, but some are really weird. Stories of long ongoing relationships, strange languages, ties to cavemen or devolved humans, time portals, and yes even UFOs. All of this and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about what they have been up to lately. Then, Kyle talks about a recent sighting of a large bioluminescent flying Bat Man seen in Guyana, South America. Then, Cam tells a horrific story of a man abducted and then killed by a Sasquatch back in the 1970s.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam tells the strange story about the lost Amber Room! During WWII, Hitler’s Nazis stole some 600,000 pieces of art from across Europe. By the end of the war, billions of pounds worth of artwork had been scattered to the four winds, the Nazi looting had been on an industrial scale. Whilst some pieces of stolen art have been returned to their rightful owners, many are still missing, including a priceless collection of stunning amber panels, known as the Amber Room - perhaps the most valuable items ever looted by the fascist regime. The room was called the ‘Eighth Wonder of the World’ and one of Russia’s most treasured artifacts. After its looting, the room was returned to Germany and put on display, but it disappeared in the closing months of the war. Its fate is one of the greatest mysteries of WWII.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about their week, allergies and other things that have been happening to them in general before they get into the news. Then, a woman in West Virginia saw two wolves much larger than they should have been. She believes that they were in fact Werewolves! Then a listener of the show writes in with her very own time slip experience one day while out walking her dog.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up the Airscare of the late 19th and early 20th century. Kenneth Arnold is generally given credit for kicking off the UFO object craze in 1947 by sighting what he called “Flying Saucers” in the skies over the Pacific Northwest. However, 50 years before, Sacramento grabbed the attention of the entire nation when a giant object was spotted one night flying over the capital city. The mystery of the secret airship flying over Sacramento on a storm swept November night in the late 19th century was never solved, and the story spread throughout the nation with eventual sightings in the Midwest, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, Great Britain, Australia and even New Zealand.</p>
 <p>What were these mysterious aircraft seen over the cities and fields of North America and beyond? Was it something cooked up by the media to spark paper sales? Was the United States experimenting with a torpedo-shaped balloon? Was it a secret social club experimenting with some incredible feats in early aviation or was it something extra-terrestrial?</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys talk to friends and colleagues Micah Hanks, Dakota Waddell and Jeff smith about their new podcast "<em>Sasquatch Tracks</em>".  <em>Sasquatch Tracks </em>examines the question of whether large undiscovered species may still exist, with special emphasis on the Sasquatch in North America, and similar claims of apelike “relict hominoids” and other animals purported to exist around the world.</p>
 <p>Their approach is critically minded, yet open to the possibility that the world of zoology may have kept a few secrets–possibly even <em>big </em>ones–well into the modern era. As recently as 1976, discoveries like the megamouth shark by a U.S navy research vessel near Oahu, Hawaii, have shown that some large species have indeed managed to elude us. Similar discoveries like the okapi <em>(Okapia johnstoni)</em> in 1901, as well as the mountain gorilla <em>(Gorilla gorilla beringei) </em>the following year in 1902 have turned up new specimens that surprised scientists and expanded our knowledge of the natural world.</p>
 <p>The study of cryptozoology entails the scientific search for animals, both great and small, that remain undiscovered by science. Some discoveries may come out of the blue, with a previously unrecognized specimen turning up in the wild, or even in existing museum collections of fossils retrieved decades beforehand. Other times, the cultural traditions and folklore of indigenous groups may provide scientists with clues about new, undiscovered species. Unfortunately, cryptozoology is often deemed “pseudoscience” on account of its association with fantastic claims; these are often presented in a sensational way that offers little incentive for serious biologists, anthropologists, zoologists, or other professionals who otherwise might be interested in at least considering such topics.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> we have on fellow Podcaster and friend Darren Schaefer on to talk about DB Cooper and his amazing podcast "<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cooper-vortex/id1439712498">The Cooper Vortex</a>"!</p>
 <p>It's the only unsolved hijacking case in the history of commercial aviation. On the afternoon of November 24, 1971—Thanksgiving Eve—a man aboard a flight from Portland to Seattle threatened to detonate a bomb if he didn't receive a hefty ransom. Once he got the money, the hijacker released all passengers and ordered the crew to fly to Mexico. En route, with cash in hand, the man parachuted from the aircraft. This man was known as D.B. Cooper. After a 45-year FBI investigation, his identity, whereabouts and motive remain unknown. No one even knows whether he survived the jump. The FBI followed thousands of leads to find Cooper, considering more than 800 suspects in the five years following the incident. As of today no one knows who D.B. Cooper really was!</p>
 <p>Darren Schaefer is seeking the answers to this incredible story each and every episode of his amazing podcast "<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cooper-vortex/id1439712498">The Cooper Vortex</a>".  All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how the kids are back in school, the Stanley Cup playoffs are back, Baseball is back and the NBA playoffs are back. Then they get into the news with a sighting of a new species of shrew as well as many other creatures found for the first time in the last couple of years. Then, a listener writes in with some strange sightings they have had over the years. </p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some very strange cases of past lives! For nearly 15 years, Jim Tucker has been investigating claims made by children, usually between the ages of 2 and 6 years old, who say they’ve had past lives.The children are sometimes able to provide enough detail about those lives that their stories can be traced back to an actual person—rarely famous and often entirely unknown to the family—who died years before.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives author and friend of the show Ryan Sprague joins us to talk about the recent announcements in the UFO world, what are these other world vehicles, who pilots them and why is the government coming forward now? Also he talks about his latest work "Somewhere In The Skies, 2nd edition: A Human Approach to the UFO Phenomenon".</p>
 <p>In this updated and expanded second edition, Ryan Sprague revisits many, and introduces new stories of those who have seen extraordinary things in our skies and how these incredible events have changed them. While reports of UFOs and close encounters are littered with dates, times, and descriptions, they rarely focus on the people who've had the experience. Could both the positive and negative implications, whether subtle or revelatory, further our knowledge of what these phenomena represent? Through detailed testimony from credible witnesses and insight from those in the psychological, academic, and scientific fields, Somewhere in the Skies: A Human Approach to the UFO Phenomenon weaves together a story of stories, attempting to get to the heart of these mysteries one experience at a time.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about Body Armor sports drinks  and then they get into some strange sightings. First off, some more details regarding the sighting of four small hairy hominids that were observed by fossil hunters in west Texas. Then, Cam brings up some more small creatures like the Venezuelan Hairy Dwarves! Which are a variety of hairy humanoid that is shorter than the average human. Unlike the more traditional types of hairy humanoid, such as Bigfoot, hairy dwarfs are technologically adept. In fact, they are often associated with UFOs. In the early days of the UFO craze, witnesses often reported that the aliens were hairy dwarfs instead of the classic "grays" that seem to be most popular today. In time, hairy dwarf reports became much less common. Hairy dwarfs are hardly ever reported today.</p>
 <p>Then, Kyle tells a story sent in by a listener who has also seen a black smoke serpent manifesting in there bedroom at night. Why does this seem to be happening during sleep paralysis? Who or what is creating them. Also, a woman tells about two BEKs showing up on her front porch at 2:30am in Alabama in the middle of the summer while be decked out in winter jackets!</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's recent trip the coast of Texas with his family. How he had to leave early because of an incoming Hurricane or Tropical Storm. Then, they get into the news where a person in Montrose, Colorado witnessed a small circular ship with its landed gear down and a hatch with stairs folded down to the ground. Next to the ship where green lizard-looking beings. Their eyes were bright yellow and there were some tanks on their backs along with another bag. They didn't have fingers but webbed hands with what looked like bow and arrow type weapons they were holding. Their bodies were thin and scaly, even their legs. Their feet had V-shaped toes and looked incredibly tall and strong.</p>
 <p>Then, a listener from Hungary wrote into the show about a smoke serpent that was observed in their bedroom one evening while frozen in bed. Apparently they believed they were stricken with sleep paralysis, but actually remembering this allowed them fall back asleep unscathed.</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up some strange and interesting stories from the Hospital. Nobody deals with death more than nurses and doctors. And if you think they might have a ghost story or two to tell, you'd be wrong. They have a lot more than just one or two ghost stories. They have dozens. Some of the creepiest, freakiest, weirdest, and wildest stories have been told by nurses and doctors who have had exceptional encounters with the paranormal.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about family life, what workflow works best for them and how Kyle has become a cat person over the years. Then they get into the news with some strange sightings.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up a few lesser known serial killers including one known as the Wolf of Moscow! The term "serial killer" was coined in the mid-1970s by Robert Ressler, the former director of the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. He chose "serial" because the police in England called these types of murders "crimes in a series" and because of the serial films that he grew up watching. Prior to this, these types of crimes were sometimes known as mass murders or stranger-on-stranger crime. What makes them commit such crimes?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about Cam's recent remodel of his bathrooms in his house and the return of baseball up in Oklahoma. Then, they get into some news about an unknown green eyed bided in Kentucky, another Glimmer Man sighting from North Carolina and a sparsely furred humanoid in Kentucky. After the break we speak with Joshua Cutchin and Timothy Renner about their new book "<em>Where the Footprints End: High Strangeness and the Bigfoot Phenomenon, Volume I: Folklore</em>". Our forests seem to be hiding something much more complex than an undiscovered gorilla. Bigfoot may be howling from a lonely mountaintop, but the bigfoot phenomenon is whispering secrets... if we will only listen.</p>
 <p>Eyewitnesses, investigators, and cryptozoologists worldwide contend ample evidence exists supporting the survival of large, hairy, apelike creatures alongside mankind today, lurking in the wilderness. By all appearances, these beings seem wholly natural, interacting with their surroundings and leaving behind hair, blood, droppings, and, of course, footprints.</p>
 <p>Yet despite their apparently physical nature, bigfoot and its hairy hominid kin consistently appear mired in High Strangeness—the peculiar, ineffable, and nonsensical absurdities so often encountered in paranormal phenomena.Some sightings seem more consistent with mythology than biology. Bigfoot often present supernatual attributes, like luminescent eyes or the ability to pass, ghostlike, through structures. Anomalous lights are regulalry seen in areas of frequent sasquatch activity. Footprints persistently, if rarely, display odd numbered toes, and—most bafflingly—bigfoot trackways suddenly terminate in the middle of open, untouched terrain.</p>
 <p>In Volume 1 of Where the Footprints End: High Strangeness and the Bigfoot Phenomenon, authors Joshua Cutchin and Timothy Renner carefully examine not only the intersection of hairy apemen with global folklore—of poltergeists, faeries, extraterrestrials, magic, witches, ghosts, and archetypal women-in-white—but also question the fundamental assumptions underlying contemporary cryptozoological beliefs surrounding bigfoot.</p>
 <p>Joshua Cutchin: Is a North Carolina native with a longstanding interest in Forteana. He holds a Masters in Music Literature and a Masters in Journalism from the University of Georgia, and currently resides in Roswell, Georgia. He is the author of three books: 2015's "A Trojan Feast: The Food and Drink Offerings of Aliens, Faeries, and Sasquatch" (translated into Spanish as "Banquete Troyano"); 2016's "The Brimstone Deceit: An In-Depth Examination of Supernatural Scents, Otherworldly Odors, &amp; Monstrous Miasmas"; and 2018's "Thieves in the Night: A Brief History of Supernatural Child Abductions." All are published by Anomalist Books. Joshua is also a contributor to Robbie Graham's 2017 collection of ufological essays "UFOs: Reframing the Debate," as well as David Weatherly's 2018 Sasquatch collection "Wood Knocks: Vol. 3."</p>
 <p>Cutchin is also a published composer and maintains an active performing schedule as a jazz and rock tuba player, having appeared on eight albums and live concert DVDs. Joshua has appeared on a variety of paranormal programs discussing his work, including Coast to Coast AM, Mysterious Universe, Binnall of America, and The Gralien Report. He can be heard on the weekly podcast Where Did the Road Go? and maintains an online presence at <a href="http://JoshuaCutchin.com">JoshuaCutchin.com</a>.</p>
 <p>Timothy Renner: Is an illustrator, author, and folk musician living in Pennsylvania. His illustrations have appeared in the pages of various books, magazines, fanzines and comics as well as on many record and CD covers. Since 1995, Timothy has been making music both solo and with his band, Stone Breath. Timothy is the creator of "Strange Familiars", a podcast concerning the paranormal, weird history, folklore and the occult. He makes regular appearances on the paranormal radio show, "Where Did the Road Go?", and has appeared as a guest on many other podcasts and radio programs, including "Coast to Coast AM".</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the boys start the show off talking about Kyle had to get up early and help an old man who fell down at his house next door to where Kyle lives. Then, the guys into some strange sightings including a limping Humanoid, a devil dog, a werewolf and a possible Rake! After the break Kyle brings up some UFO encounters by people in law enforcement.</p>
 <p>Among the many witnesses of UFOs, some of them make up the men and women of law enforcement. Like we talk about so many times on this show, for some reason stories from credible witnesses like pilots, radar operators and police officers seem to have more believability over stories from just any old person. These are people out doing their job to serve and protect, yet sometimes it seems that they come across things that nothing in their experience or training has prepared them for. On todays show we talk about some very strange encounters by people in law enforcement.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about fake martial arts instructors vs. real MMA fighters and how it doesn't work out for them. Then, they discuss a listener story about seeing a shadowy figure standing by the basement entrance. Then, back in April of 2014 in the state of Alabama, a person on Easter claims their son saw a giant black Easter Bunny staring at him through his bedroom window! Next, two sightings of strange transformer looking flying humanoids have been spotted and filmed. Then a woman sees a pig like creature near the side of the road.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up the numerous Dwarf or Pygmie skeletons found throughout several states in North America. Descriptions of a subterranean race of dwarves or Elves exists across the globe. It is also common that the dwarfs are also attached to the "spirit realm." The origin of these "Earth Spirits" also known as Elementals is with the Fallen Angels who produced both the giants and the race of Elves. Like the giants, their spirits are forever bound to the earth, according to the Book of Enoch. Along with this many Native American tribes have a shared legend about a race of dwarves or pygmies.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk abut whether or not Kyle survived COVID-19 or not and the recent Live Stream the boys did over the weekend. Then, on Saturday March 28, 2020, the eyewitness, along with his mother and a friend, were at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. They were hiking in the area of the Elk &amp; Bison Prairie when they saw some strange paw prints. Then, they saw a dogman like creature! Next, a person from Banff, Scotland writes that they believe they saw the Glimmer Man, but in this case it was a Glimmer Woman!</p>
 <p>Then, a man out working in the backyard heard some strange grunts coming from the nearby woods. After a little while he actually saw two large, hairy creatures lumbering through the forest. Then, a listener from Toronto, Canada tells their account of a possible Time Slip! During the main segment, Cam brings up some very strange creatures lurking in the wild woods of Georgia. Georgia, named after King George II of England, is one of the original thirteen colonies. Of the 37 million acres of land in Georgia, 24.8 million acres of that is forestland. The Peach State is the fourth largest state east of the Mississippi River, and is home to mountains, rivers, and monsters.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how everyone around town is being well mannered and courteous because of the COVID-19 lock down. Then, they get into some very strange news. A person in Limestone, Maine saw a bizarre ape like thing with a large T-Rex tail walking across a parking lot before climbing a tree. Then, a couple walking their dogs encountered something very strange, a large flying humanoid. A person in Canada saw an upright walking wolf or dogman near the side of the road while driving and a possible Pukwudgie was seen in the woods of Maine.</p>
 <p>During the main segment Kyle talks about some possible UFO sightings in Australia, including the Knowles family incident. An Australian family on a road trip was pursued by a glowing UFO, and in full view of witnesses in other cars, the UFO landed on top of them, picked up their car in the air and dropped it several meters, blowing out a tire. It was January 1988 and the Knowles family of Perth was traveling cross country when the terrifying event happened. Today we're going to dig as deep as we can into the events of that night, and see if we can determine whether this truly was an extraordinary case of intervention by aliens from another world — or if there might be some other explanation.</p>

Then, some sightings of gnomes, fey folk and a possible alien abduction. After some news Cam brings up the interesting story of McDows Hole in Texas.</p>
 <p>In the 1860s, a couple, Charlie and Jenny Papworth, moved into a cabin near the McDow Hole on the creek. The hole was named after his uncle, Jim McDow. After Charlie’s parents died, he left on a trip to complete family business. Jenny and the two children stayed behind. During the day she busied herself with her children and her chores. In the evening, she would take the children and stay at the McDow’s. One night Jenny and the kids didn’t show up. The McDows became frantic the next day. When they arrived at the cabin, they found the place in disarray and a trail of blood. Their son was found under the bed, but Jenny and the baby were never found.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a man and his son back in August of 2006 were sitting on the back porch of their house in Bensenville, Illinois when the saw a strange winged humanoid descend from a tree and pick up a squirrel with it's talons. Then, a woman shares an interesting tale of encountering real life gnomes multiple times during her life. Not only has she seen these mythical creatures, she has spoken to them and received gardening tips.</p>
 <p>After the break the guys interview James Patrick Akin about his book "Elkins Creek". In 1994, James Patrick Akin made a plaster cast of a giant footprint in the swamps of a rural Georgia county. In the years since, this cast came to be known in the Bigfoot research community as the Elkins Creek Cast. Mr. Akin was a Deputy Sheriff in Pike County, Georgia back in 1994. One night while out on patrol he call that an elderly couple had reported someone lurking around their home, making noise and tapping on the side of their home. Akin showed up, walked around the property and saw nothing. As time went on he received more and more calls out to the property, where the same elderly couple complained of someone or something tapping on the house, hitting the side of the house, peeking through windows and even calling out to their dog. Things escalated with all of the outside dogs going missing, a storage shed broken into and all of the dogfood and corn being taken. One day while out exploring Elkins Creek which the property backed to, Deputy Akin found a huge footprint in the mud. He made a cast and it was later determined to be an authentic Bigfoot footprint.</p>
 <p>James Patrick Akin, aged 52, was born in Griffin, Georgia, and raised to maturity in SunnySide, Georgia. Akin attended Griffin High School and graduated in 1984. His post-secondary education includes a Bachelor of Science degree in History and Anthropology from Georgia Southwestern State University and Masters degrees in Public Administration and Education from Columbus State University. Until recently, Akin was a Doctoral student. After completing his undergraduate university degree, Akin served as a police officer in both the Pike County and Griffin, Georgia jurisdictions. Later in his law enforcement career, his specialty was criminal street gangs and related enforcement. Subsequently, Akin left law enforcement and became a special education teacher. Akin taught until he was forced to retire due to a physical disability.</p>
 <p>His interest in the paranormal has evolved since his initial experience in 1994. Since that time, he has investigated numerous anomalous and paranormal events. In particular, he is interested in the interaction of humanity with the spiritual world and the resultant psychic impact of symbols and symbolic representations upon human sentience, the conscious and unconscious mind, and spiritual transcendence. Additionally, he has interest in the investigation of UFOs, cryptozoological phenomenon, spiritualism, and varied occult beliefs and practices. In his book, Akin takes the reader along as he casts the giant footprint and explores the theories behind Bigfoot research and the interrelated nature of the unexplained.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how woodchucks and ground hogs are the same animal, the upcoming movie Swamp Thing and how Kyle's children are upset about their slow internet speeds. Then, according to a local news report, the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense will be publishing secret UFO reports for the very first time. From the early 1950s until 2009, a department in the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (MoD) documented and investigated reports of UFOs. Now, more than a decade after the program ended, many of those formerly classified files about UFO sightings will be made available to the public for the first time. Then, a woman claims that back in the winter of 1990 she awoke from a very deep sleep around 3:35am and noticed that she was not alone in her room. She was abducted by aliens, shown a hybrid type baby and had her kidney removed.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very unusual sightings of large Hyena like creatures that have been seen in North America. These are much different than just a black market pet or perhaps an animal that escaped from a local zoo. These creatures are sometimes seen standing upright on two legs very similar to a dogman or werewolf. It turns out that a creature similar to a Hyena plays a role in the lore and legends of the Ioway Indians of the Great Plains of the American West, a creature they call the <em>Shunka Warakin</em>, which means in their language “carries off dogs,” and which is known by various other local names. It is a brutish, dark-furred beast with a sloping back, massive jaws, long front legs compared to the rear, and looking very much like what we today would know as a hyena.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about where they've been and Kyle's recent hospital stay with double pneumonia and a blood infection known as streptococcus. Also, Cam had a recent trip to New Orleans, Louisiana where he visited an amazing World War II museum, Bourbon Street and some less desirable areas.</p>
 <p>Then they get into the news where apparently two people in North Carolina say they came upon a "huge bigfoot!" As they were driving they passed what they thought was a strange looking man but turned out to be bigfoot. Then, a young girl was swimming in a lake a mile or so from home with her brothers and friends. Well as the sun was setting it was time for her to return home. On her hike home through the woods she was followed by a giant hairy hominid. Then, some people have very strange possible time glitches or time slips.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle, brings up the interesting unsolved case of Septic Tank Sam. "Septic Tank Sam" was the name given by investigators to an unidentified man found in a septic tank outside of Tofield, Alberta, Canada in 1977."Sam" was found in a 1.8 meter deep septic tank on an abandoned farm house, 13km west of Tofield, by owners of the property who had been searching the old septic tank for a pump. Investigating officers described his death as one of the most vindictive and sadistic crimes that they had ever encountered. According to the autopsy, he had been tied up and beaten while his body had been repeatedly burned using a small butane blowtorch and cigarettes. He had also been sexually mutilated before he was finally shot in the head and chest. He was then rolled up in a yellow bed-sheet tied with nylon rope and dumped head first into the septic tank, which had been partially filled with water. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about the holidays, time off of work, family and their recent trip to Arizona. Then they briefly talk about how the weird hum heard around the world has been solved. Then, a woman in Illinois sees not one but four red eyed winged humanoids flying above her backyard. Then, early Denisovan humans were much more complex than originally thought. The discovery of the Tibetan mandible solves that mystery, and also expands the known Denisovan territory by more than a thousand miles.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam and Kyle talk about their recent trip to the Mogollon Rim in Arizona. This particular rim or range is known to posses a large hairy bigfoot like creature known locally as the Mogollon Monster. Mogollon Monster is a type of bigfoot originated from Mogollon Rim, Arizona. Reports of footprints, video, and hair samples have been documented, but no conclusive evidence has been found to date. The Mogollon Monster is reported to be a bipedal humanoid over 7 feet tall with inhuman strength and large eyes that some claim to be "wild and red". Its body is said to be covered with long black or reddish brown hair, with the exclusion of the chest, face, hands and feet. Reports claim it has a strong and pungent odor described as that of "dead fish, a skunk with bad body odor, decaying peat moss and the musk of a snapping turtle". It said that the creature is omnivorous, nocturnal, and very violent. It is generally reported to walk with wide, inhuman strides; leave behind footprints measuring 22 inches in length. It was said to produce whistle sound or scream and explore campsites during night. It is also believed to consume deer and other wildlife by decapitating them.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about a Sasquatch encounter in Connecticut. Then, a listener writes in about 2 large hulking creatures seen running down the road at night in Toledo, Ohio.  After the break Cam brings up the very strange insect looking aliens that have been encountered by only a small group of people. What are they? Where do they come from? And what do they want from us?</p>
 <p>Mantis aliens are perhaps the most mysterious and unsettling of all extraterrestrial creatures. These beings appear within many abduction scenarios, with abductees reporting the ominous presence of these entities looming over their beds as they wake in the dead of night. While the Mantis is not as widely reported as the Grey or Nordic alien, it still holds an important role within many extraterrestrial contact scenarios.</p>
 <p>By far the most striking aspect of the Mantis alien is its physical kinship with the praying mantis, the carnivorous and bipedal insect of its namesake. Many report these beings as 6-7 feet tall, with long, thin torsos. Their necks, arms and hands have additional joints. Their heads are insect-like and triangular, with large, slanted eyes of deep brown to black.</p>
 <p>Most Mantids are described as dark brown, but other colors such as green and black have also been encountered. Their bodies are composed of a segmented exoskeleton, and some abductees have reported that the Mantis seem to be coated in an oily substance. Mantis are often encountered wearing long robes in a variety of colors, perhaps signifying rank, while some are unclothed.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Anaheim investigator Julissa Trapp is not like other detectives. She’s the only woman on the homicide squad, and a skilled chameleon: undercover cop in vice stings, crime-scene commander, patient confidante of killers. A master interrogator, she invokes her personal experience – and deepest griefs – as a tool to elicit confessions. When a young woman’s body is found at a trash-sorting plant, Trapp learns the murder may be linked to the disappearance of three other women in nearby Santa Ana. Trapp embarks on a dark journey that brings her face to face with a man who takes “a little piece of her soul.” The series is about a singular detective on a relentless, sometimes lonely quest for answers.</p>
 <p>From the Los Angeles Times and Wondery, “Detective Trapp” is a new story from Christopher Goffard, the writer and host of “Dirty John.”</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about their recent Thanksgiving Day celebration as well as Cam's recent birthday dinner. Then they discuss some strange sounds heard in the woods near Kenton, Tennessee, a recent Bigfoot Report from Arizona and Satanists may be attacking animals in Britain.  After the break the boys play some audio clips from eyewitnesses who claim to have unbelievable close encounter experiences with the legendary Bigfoot.</p>
 <p>Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a giant ape-like creature that is said to roam remote forests from all over the world. There is scant physical evidence that such creatures exist, but Bigfoot buffs are convinced that they do. While most sightings of Bigfoot occur in the Northwest, the creatures have been reported all over the planet. Interest in Bigfoot grew rapidly during the second half of the 20th century, spurred by magazine articles of the time, most seminally a December 1959 "True" article describing the discovery of large, mysterious footprints the year before in Bluff Creek, California. If you don't believe in Bigfoot (singular or plural), you're not alone. According to a 2007 Baylor Religion Survey, only 16 percent of people surveyed said that Bigfoot "absolutely" or "probably" exist, with 44 percent responding "probably not" and about 40 percent saying that they "absolutely [do] not" exist.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about soda, fizzy water and coffee. Then they get into a strange sighting where a person believes they encountered a large 7ft tall Bear Man! That's right it was not a person, bear, or sasquatch. Then, a skin walker terrorizes a group of young men in the deserts of New Mexico.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some truly disturbing encounters with giant insects. For most people insects like roaches, spiders and bugs of all kinds are revolting and disgusting at best. They have been used in all sorts of horror movies over the years and make almost anyone cringe when they see these alien like creepy crawlies on the big screen. Far from Hollywood, there are actual real life reports out there that seem to take things to a new level. That's right, giant insects! From giant beetles attaching themselves to commercial airliners, to giant deer killing centipedes, sightings of UGE bugs have been seen from the deep forest of the Congo, Amazon and Vietnam. Join us and listen to some these terrifying sightings.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about horror movies, the upcoming Halloween season and what they have been up to lately. Then, a man in Burlington County New Jersey claims he witnessed a baby Bigfoot when he was driving his truck in June of 2019. At first the witness claims he at first thought it was a giant ground hog, but then it stood up. Then, a person and a couple of friends were hanging out one night on a levee near Stockton, California when they witnesses some very strange lights in the sky. The next morning they were awoken by the ringing of their doorbell. Outside the door was standing what appeared to be a Man In Black.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up the horrible story of Stalin's Cannibal Island. Eighty-six years ago in May, a small flotilla of lumber barges pulled up to Nazino Island and off-loaded about 3,000 "settlers" with orders to construct a "special settlement," as their little corner of Stalin's GULAG – the network of labor camps that spread across the Soviet Union where millions of people were repressed and killed -- was euphemistically called. At least 23 of the prisoners were already dead. Without tools or shelter or food and surrounded by armed guards who shot anyone who tried to brave the icy river, the prisoners quickly fell victim to starvation, disease, violence, and the brutal elements. And still, additional barges continued to pull up at the island. Numerous gruesome incidents of cannibalism were reported. So many, in fact, that locals came to call it Cannibal Island or the Island of Death. By August, at least 4,000 people were dead or missing. According to a Soviet document dated August 20, 1933, there were only 2,200 survivors out of the 6,700 prisoners who had been sent to Nazino, a low-lying, swampy strip some 3 kilometers long and about 600 meters wide. Out of the 6,700 prisoners sent to Nazino Island only 2,200 survived.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>American Elections: Wicked Game is a new podcast from the host of Wondery’s American History Tellers (Lindsay Graham) that will explore all 58 presidential elections, leading up to the big day in November 2020. From the inevitable election of George Washington in 1789, to Donald Trump’s surprise electoral victory in 2016, we’ll attempt to discover if there ever was a “good ol’ days,” or if presidential politics have always been played dirty.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the recent flooding in southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. Then they get into actual newspaper clipping from the Hammond Times which is located in Munster, Indiana. This particular clipping was from Friday, October 25, 1935 and the article tells a very interesting story about a lost race of Wildmen in the wilderness of British Columbia. Then a person and their brother saw a giant dragonfly near Bolton, England back in 2002. If that's not strange enough, another person saw a gigantic Humming Bird too. This large bird was feeding on a lemon tree. Now some 10 years later, the witness thinks that what they saw may not have been an actual humming bird but perhaps a fairy or spirit being.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very strange mysteries from the Land Down Under. Apparently our friends from Australia have a wide range of strange crypts, legends and lore. All of this and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the new movie IT part 2 and Kyle's son Luke's obsession with seeing it. Then they get into what's been generally going on with the two of them over the last couple of days before getting into a strange sighting of a possible Dogman back in the 1960's.</p>
 <p>Then Kyle brings up the incredible sightings of something very strange just under the service of the Pacific ocean about a 100 miles west of San Diego by two F-18 pilots and multiple radar operators in the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group on November 14, 2004.  It began as a routine naval training exercise. But it would soon become one of the best-documented—and most baffling—UFO sightings of the 21st century. Witnesses included highly trained military personnel—among them several deeply experienced radar operators and fighter pilots—who at the time of the sightings were at the controls of arguably the most advanced flight technology ever created. And yet none can explain what they saw.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's birthday and Cam's run in with food poisoning. Then they get into some news and Cam talks about Pierre Denys de Montfort, the Kraken, Great White sharks, Sea Serpents, the San Clemente Sea Monster and other watery beasts!</p>
 <p>In 1820 a man died of starvation in a cold Parisian gutter. He was given a pauper’s burial and the few who attended did so only to snicker at the feeble-minded fool that believed in sea monsters. The man was the French zoologist Pierre Denys de Montfort. Had he lived until 1857 he would have seen his ‘wild stories’ vindicated. Pierre Denys de Montfort was a malacologist, an expert in mollusks. He was also a scientific heretic, for he dared to research something that the high priests of science deemed to be an old wives’ tale, giant cephalopods.</p>
 <p>He wrote an addendum for Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon’s <em>Histoire naturelle générale et particulière</em>. Comte de Buffon had been the director of Jardin des Plantes and this was a feather in the young naturalist’s cap. <em>Suites a Buffon</em> was devoted to mollusks. During this time, he investigated the origins of ambergris (the indigestible beaks and claws of cephalopods vomited up by sperm whales like gigantic owl pellets) and became interested in the idea of huge cephalopods. He interviewed American whalers who had settled in France about the evidence for such creatures.</p>
 <p>One such man, Ben Johnson, told of a monstrous tentacle found in the mouth of a sperm whale they had killed. The tentacle was 35 feet long and had been severed at both ends, De Montfort reckoned another 10-20 feet of it had been lost. It was as thick as a mast with suckers the size of hats. Another man, Reynolds, told of seeing what he thought was a red sea serpent laying next to a whale they had killed. It was discovered to be a massive tentacle 45 feet long with suckers as large as plates.</p>
 <p>At the time no one believed him. We now know that the Colossal Squid is a very real creature. Therfore, Pierre Denys de Montfort was a prophet! All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

They talk about Kyle's love of corn and watching M. Night Shyamalan movies. Then, they get into the news where a person named K.M. witnessed what looked like a giant Pterosaur flying over Wheaton, Illinois. The witness noticed a strange form flying in the sky at an altitude of approximately 200 feet. The profile was that of a Pterosaur, in particular the long tail with a 'spade' on the end. The head was indistinguishable because of the angle, but the wings were wide and similar to the classic form. The creature was dark in color and propelled itself with slow deliberate wing flaps. Then, a person had a strange skin walker sighting in Northwestern Arizona. The witness was a child and was playing near a creek with some G.I. Joe toys when they encountered something strange in the woods.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam talks about paranormal events experienced by the U.S. Border patrol. When Rocky Elmore joined the United States Border Patrol, he knew it would be a journey fraught with danger. But little did he know that the very real trails he walked night after night would soon lead him into surreal encounters from a different dimension. This was never more evident than when the ghost of a recently fallen fellow agent began to appear on top of the cliff from which he died. It marked the beginning of the end to one of the most bizarre series of events in the history of the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the move to the brand new studio (Skelekin Studios B). Then, they get into the weekly news starting with a strange sighting someone had of a giant bird  back 1993 in Chino, California. The person noticed what appeared to be a 5 foot tall black bird just chilling on a gate. Then, a person who was working in the Los Padres National Forest had what they believe was a Sasquatch sighting. Stranger yet, the park rangers seemed unfazed by the sighting and mentioned that they have seen the creature multiple times.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some very strange encounters people had with Bigfoot, a giant Hyena and even a giant Frog Man. All of these stories are detailed in Lon Strickler's book Phantoms and Monsters: Mysterious Encounters! All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Kyle "Big Phizzy" Philson has still been trying all types of Fizzy water and how it's helped him cut back on drinking soda. They give a shout-out to Bushwick Bill of the famous rap group the Ghetto Boys who recently passed away. Then they read a strange listener story and Cam reports on a strange troll like creature that was recently caught on someone's security camera.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up even more sightings of werewolves or dolmen! Werewolf accusations were not entirely uncommon in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Werewolf and witch hysteria sort of developed in tandem. Indeed, some people were even accused of both. Such accusations, and the subsequent confessions and executions, were often politically expedient. But sometimes the fear was absolutely warranted, whether the danger lurked clad in the fur of a wolf or the clothes of a man.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's trip down to the coast in Galveston and Cam's camping trip to a dark sky region of northern Texas where he's going to attempt to shoot the Milky Way with his camera. Then, Kyle reads a listener story that was sent to them about a haunted fraternity house. Apparently the house was haunted possibly by the ghost of young girl who was killed in a car wreck as well as strange black mass. Then, Cam brings up some strange sightings of the famous Thunderbird in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some more sightings of Dogman or Werewolf including the crazy story of the Morbach Monster. There’s a lycan whose allegedly been running around the Wittlich Area of Germany since the early 1810s. This particularly nasty werewolf, known as the Morbach Monster, is worth mentioning because of its notorious origin and rather contemporary sighting.</p>
 <p>The legend of the Morbach Monster begins with a soldier named Thomas Johannes Baptist Schwytzer, who had a unique military career. He served in Napolean’s Grande Armee during the commander’s failed attempt to conquer Russia. Schwytzer was there when the Russians abandoned Moscow in 1812 and set fire to the city, ultimately destroying three-quarters of it.  Decimated by battle, disease and starvation, Napolean’s army was effectively in ruin. Sensing defeat and fearing for his life, Schwytzer deserted Napolean and fled back to his home in Alsace.</p>
 <p>Schwytzer fell in with a group of Russian deserters who joined him on his journey back to France. Roughly 160 miles north of Alsace, the group came upon the rural German village of Wittlich. Desperately in need of supplies, the men raided a farmhouse and, tragically, murdered the family of farmers. According to the legend, the farmer’s wife, who helplessly watched the slaughter of her husband and sons, placed the following curse on Schwytzer:</p>
 <p>‘From now on, at each full moon, you will change into a rapid wolf!’ she cried. Infuriated by her scorn, Schwytzer crushed the woman’s skull but it was too late. His ill-fated attempt to avoid the curse failed.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off chatting about what they've been up to lately. Then the get right into the news where a person tells Lon over at Phantoms and Monsters a very interesting story. The person claims that when they were very young about 3 years old, they had multiple encounters with large Ant People. Some researchers claim that these giant Ant People are really just the Greys! Even a small group of Native Americans talk about the Ant People that lived in the local caves and caverns.</p>
 <p>Then, Cam brings up a new interesting find in the Philippines. Researchers in the Philippines announced today that they have discovered a species of ancient human previously unknown to science. The small-bodied hominin, named <em>Homo luzonensis</em>, lived on the island of Luzon at least 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. The hominin—identified from a total of seven teeth and six small bones—hosts a patchwork of ancient and more advanced features. The landmark discovery, announced in <em>Nature</em> on Wednesday, makes Luzon the third Southeast Asian island in the last 15 years to bear signs of unexpectedly ancient human activity.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some more hauntings and Kyle brings up the legend of The White Witch of Jamaica. All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how they both narrowly escaped a horrible hail storm and tornado recently. They talk about the Stanley Cup playoffs as well as Kyle disliking of the Pittsburg Penguins. Then they start the news. First up another Glimmer Man sighting from Kentucky. One night while out getting medicine for his sick wife a man saw something strange in the road. A deer was being pursed by something, but what? Then, a man in Logan County, Oklahoma claims he saw an unidentified bipedal creature. He and his dog were sitting on their porch in October of 2018 when they saw something disturbing. The man said he saw two deer running south and then, seconds later, a biped running in the same direction.</p>
 <p>After the Break Cam brings up several strange sightings in and around retail stores and Kyle brings up the serial killer simply known as The Vampire of Sacramento. Born on May 23, 1950, Richard Chase was later to become one of America’s most notorious serial killers. Earning the nickname, “Vampire of Sacramento,” he terrorized California and drank the blood of his victims to satisfy a persistent delusion. Under the belief that Nazis were attempting to turn his blood into powder, he drank blood to ward off this medical disaster.</p>
 <p>Born into a strict family and subject to much physical abuse by his father, Richard Chase began showing signs of mental illness early. He became dependent on alcohol in his childhood and made a habit of starting fires and mutilating animals. As a teenager, he could not sustain normal sexual function without the aid of disturbing practices, such as necrophilia and animal murder. His delusions began around this time and his father forced him to move to his own apartment, where he began to eat animals raw after he killed them.</p>
 <p>In December of 1977 he had his first killing of another human being. This time a drive by shooting of man just carrying in his groceries. He went on to kill many more before he was eventually caught by police. Richard Chase was sentenced to death in prison by means of the gas chamber. Before the system could kill him, he saved up his prescribed anti-depressants and overdosed on them in his cell, effectively ending his life.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about some new sound effects that Kyle has been working on and his recent failed Turkey hunt. After the discussion about hunting and how big of an idiot Kyle is, they start with some news. First off, a person by the name of DG recalls a strange sighting they had one night around 2:00am on the west side of Joliet, Illinois. The person was just chillin watching some television with the windows open when they heard what sounded like a woman screaming. Upon closer inspection the person saw some large humanoid with black wings perched on a neighbor's roof!</p>
 <p>Then, a Utah man claims he was just looking through his spotting scope in his backyard when he spotted something strange on one of the nearby mountain sides. He grabbed his phone and shot a short clip of something upright, hominid looking walking up a ridge. Was it Bigfoot? The man who shot the footage certainly thinks so.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some more of these strange sightings of the Black Stick Man! The Black Stick Men are a species of strange humanoid beings rarely seen by humans. They are often described as being similar to typical cartoon stick men, making them some of the strangest beings ever encountered. Black Stick Men are often described as being exactly identical to the typical cartoon stick man: tall, thin, and black in color. They are said to move in an odd galloping motion; some are even said to float above the ground. Supposedly they are two-dimensional creatures, meaning they are exactly the same regardless of what angle they are viewed from. A variant kind of enromous stick men have occassionally been seen in the UK.</p>
 <p>Then Cam brings up the true story behind the famous song Phantom 309. On Jan. 29, 1963, John William “Pete” Trudelle drove a tanker truck to the Chelsea River Bulk Petroleum Facility north of Boston to load up on 4,600 gallons of gasoline. Trudelle turned around and started to make the several-hour trip back to Keene, New Hampshire, near the eastern bank of the Connecticut River, just across from the state of Vermont. He started up Route 1, just north of Boston in  Saugus, Mass., on the Newburyport Turnpike. The intersection of Route 129 and Route 1 in Saugus was treacherous. Trudelle passed under the bridge, where a blind spot impeded drivers as they went into a dip. Little did Trudelle know that there was a car stopped under the bridge, where it was waiting for a school bus to pick up children. There was no way Trudelle could stop. Rather than plowing into the back of the two vehicles stopped, he crashed the tanker into the bridge abutment. Trudelle was unable to escape the cab as the 4,600 gallons of gas erupted. The driver of the car, Robert Mayer of Stamford, Connecticut, tried to escape, but was overtaken by the flames. The bus was engulfed in flames, but the six children and the driver on board had time to escape. About 10 seconds after the passengers and driver got out, the bus burst into flames.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Off The Cuff, the guys start the show off talking about Cam's recent bow hunting adventures and the enormous wild hog he just shot with his Black Widow recurve. Then Kyle brings up the strange story of an airliner that went missing for almost 4 decades. The account of the Santiago Flight 513 is truly one of the most mysterious and mind-bending encounters on record. One where a plane took off from Germany in 1954, disappeared and was presumed crashed, before reappearing again over the skies of Brazil some thirty-five years later and performing a perfect, standard landing. What’s more, the aircraft appeared brand new as opposed to nearly four decades old. Although the story first appeared in ‘World Weekly News’, which would usually result in its instant dismissal by even the most enthusiastic researcher of strange events, the legend has endured, lasted, and been much debated. And the fact that the plane disappeared without a trace is most certainly a fact. Did it reappear in 1989, then? And if not, what was the mysterious plane that did? And who did the skeletons they found on board belong to? Should the connections of the plane to the Lockheed group be any reason for suspicion? Is it a real story or just urban legend?</p>
 <p>Then, Cam brings up more sightings of the Giant Ground Sloth or the Mapinguari! The legend of the Mapinguari is not only one of the most terrifying monster stories in modern times, but may also be proof than an ancient creature may still roam the jungles of South America. Ground sloths are thought to have gone extinct thousands of years ago. Do stories of the Mapinguari prove the Giant Ground Sloth is still alive? If so, how? The Mapinguari is a nasty and frightening monster, one you surely do not want to tangle with should you meet in a dark corner of the forest. It's legend is cemented in South American lore, dating back for generations. Standing over nine feet tall, with nasty claws, backward-facing feet and an extra mouth on its belly, the terrible beasty would surely send you running for the hills if it didn’t get hold of you first. Though, if accounts of locals are to be believed, you’d likely smell it coming and have ample chance to get away because the Mapinguari is said to give off a horrific scent. It’s alleged to be a carnivore, and has been blamed for devouring herds of cattle, but never has there been a documented assault on a human. Mainstream scientists and researchers say this creepy cryptid probably isn’t real, of course. It’s thought to be a local legend and superstition, perpetuated by the tribes of South America.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the recent baseball tournament, the nice weather and how Kyle's name is not Phil. Kyle also speaks out about trying to out throw a couple of the other boys on the team only to injure his own arm and shoulder.

This event took place years ago near Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota.</p>
 <p>Then, a person sees what they believe was a giant ground sloth near San Jose, California. The witness said they looked out their back sliding glass door one evening about 9 years ago a spotted and odd looking creature that appeared to be between 6-7 feet tall. It had two eyes, was standing on it's hind legs and had an arched back. It also had long claws on it's paws. It's hind legs were short and it was a few inched from the glass just staring at them. The person screamed out in horror and the thing ran off.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some more stories of missing hunters and missing people along with two strange encounters with Bigfoot. All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about what they were doing over Spring Break and then they get into the news. At around 9pm local time on Saturday, March 16th, 2019, an air ambulance helicopter was flying roughly 15 miles west of central Last Vegas when something odd caught his aided eye. During an exchange with an air traffic controller, the pilot of Mercy Air 21, an Agusta 119 Koala helicopter, noted spotting an unidentified object some distance from his position and only he was likely able to see it in the darkness as he was wearing night vision goggles (NVGs). The controller responded that he had nothing on radar in the area where he was seeing the object, but when he heard the pilot could only see it through his NVGs, he responded with amazement. Then, a resident in Ohio claims he saw a short ape-like creature while out in the woods. The man says he was getting his hunting gear out of his truck when he noticed the being the mid afternoon of November 12, 2013. Perhaps the strangest thing about the hairy hominid was the fact that it was all white in color.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up the Borrego Sandman! Everyone is familiar with the legends of Bigfoot and all of his ape-like kin who are reported to dwell in the numerous remote wilderness areas and swamps throughout North America. These vast areas where man seldom treads provides a perfect refuge for these creatures where food and water are plentiful and protection from the elements can be easily attained. It may come to your surprise that the legendary monster is also a desert dweller as well. As hard as it may be to fathom there are many reports from the vast deserts of Southern California of Sasquatch-like creatures roaming the sand, much like they do in the lush forest. These very dry areas with little vegetation, and almost no water supply would seem like the last place that a 6-t0-10-foot-tall animal that weighs upwards of 400 pounds, and not to mention is covered with thick fur, would want to call home, yet the sheer number of Bigfoot sightings in these areas are too numerous to ignore. Reports from the area continue to this day. In 1998 some hikers discovered a set of strange footprints near Boundary Peak, close to the Mexican border. Likewise in 1993 a hiker saw the Borrego Sandman on the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Reports have also surfaced from military personnel at Camp Pendleton who had encounters with the creature while on maneuvers during the 1990s.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off reading a listener story that was sent to them by a person who wishes to remain anonymous. This person and her family had multiple encounters with some unknown dark entity that moved around her house and entire property. Bad things began to happen to all residents of the property including the death of several kittens until the land was prayed over. Then, a person has several encounter with what they believe was a Sasquatch in Southeast Texas.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the incredible tale of people choosing to live off the grid. One family was the Lykov family. In 1936, the Lykov family left civilization and went to live deep in the Siberian forest, where they stayed in total isolation until 1978. In 1978, a helicopter pilot was flying over the forests of Siberia when he spotted something baffling. The pilot saw a clearing several thousand feet up a mountainside. To his surprise, the clearing had what appeared to be long furrows, which seemed to indicate that people were living there. This mountain, however, was more than 150 miles from the nearest known human settlement. Furthermore, Soviet authorities had no records of anyone living in the district. The pilot had been sent to find a spot to land a group of geologists who were in the district to prospect for iron ore. When the geologists learned of the pilot’s sighting, they decided to investigate. After going up the mountain, they discovered a log cabin beside a stream. The cabin consisted of a single room that was cramped, musty, filthy, and cold. Its floor was made up of potato peel and pine-nut shells. It was hard to believe that anyone actually lived there. But, incredibly, the cabin housed a family of five. As the geologists got to know the Lykov family, they learned their remarkable story.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>Are we alone? Do aliens really exist? The existence of extraterrestrial life has captured our collective imagination for generations. Those who claim to have had encounters believe what they saw. But, what does the evidence show? Starting with the first modern day sighting by Kenneth Arnold, to the crash in Roswell, to project Blue Book, the Conlon Report, Majestic 12 and Bob Lazar, the idea of Aliens from another galaxy or another dimension visiting us is intriguing, but is it real or imagined? Extraterrestrial examines these stories, analyzing possible scientific explanations and determining what really may have happened...and whether or not we are really alone. Extraterrestrial comes to you from the Parcast Network, the storytelling team behind hit shows like Unexplained Mysteries, Serial Killers, and Conspiracy Theories.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a woman believes that her and her husband recently had a terrifying encounter with a real life Werewolf in southern California. Apparently the family was out hiking some trails on the same evening as the recent Super Blood Wolf Moon when they came across a beast covered in dark fur that was standing on two feet. At some point it fell to all fours and ran off into the bushes never to be seen or heard from again.</p>
 <p>Then, a person near Trinity, Texas saw what they believed was a Bigfoot! The person stated that he and a companion were at a local pond, scouting a future hunting location. The area is well-known for upland game. The area around the pond is very marshy, with a thick mesquite stand surrounding the opposite side. As the pair walked towards the pond, the witness noticed movement in the trees. A 7-8 ft. hairy being stepped out from behind a large tree, and began to sway back and forth approximately 40 yards away. The being seemed to be taunting the observers, though there was no sound. The witness said that it had a very broad body and that the hair color blended in with the mesquite trees.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some interesting stories of the Wood Ape in both North and South America. Apparently the elders were not surprised by sightings of the mythical beast. In fact, it seemed rather routine. All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how recently two women in Kansas say they came across a Bigfoot creature. According to the article, one of the two sisters claims they were driving on Interstate 24 when they spotted the being. They said “Around 9:35 pm I was telling my sister, who was driving, to be careful about deer running across the road, cause we had seen a few. Some did not even look at the truck we were in. Most were focused on the corn fields,” she told the BFRO about the August 2017 alleged encounter in Mitchell County. Suddenly, she says, a “big buff gorilla-looking man hopped out on all fours” out of the corn field. The woman described it as 8-feet-tall with an ape-like body. Its hair was reportedly about 3 inches long, with some bald areas on the chest and face.</p>
 <p>Then, scientists have found evidence that plants can actually <em>hear</em> the buzz of passing bees and produce sweeter nectar in response to entice the flying insects in. And flowers are technically their 'ears'. Based on observations of evening primroses (<em>Oenothera drummondii</em>), the team behind the new study discovered that within minutes of sensing the sound waves of nearby bee wings through flower petals, the concentration of the sugar in the plant's nectar was increased by an average of 20 percent. The flowers even seemed able to tune out irrelevant background noises, such as the wind. Next, the researchers want to look at how plants might respond to other sounds and animals, including humans.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle discusses a new book he just read called "Strange Tales of the Sea" by Jack Strange. What lurks beneath the waves, and onboard the most mysterious of ships? This book explores the lore and lure of the sea with myths, legends and true stories. Centuries-old folklore and tales of haunted vessels. Sea monsters and ghosts. Cannibalism at sea, and mysterious disappearances. Included are also tales of sailors ashore, and the prostitutes and crimps that preyed on them. Find out what happened to stowaways, how they were treated, and about the myth that women were not welcome on ships. All of this and more on this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about two interesting stories sent in from a fan of the show and film maker. The first story happened back when they were 11 or 12 years old in rural Virginia. They were out exploring in the woods when they came upon a possible Sasquatch Den with 3 dead whitetail deer carcasses inside. Then years later while in College they were up late doing research on an upcoming horror film about the Black Eyed Kids! While writing the script for the future film, they were harassed by eerie knocking. So was it the Black Eyed Kids?</p>
 <p>Then, another Giant Dinosaur Bird has been sighted in Lehigh County. The 47 year old construction worker said he was outside chopping firewood when we spotted the monstrous beast! In the fall of 2006 in rural Ohio, a person had a bizarre encounter with the Fae or even a Pukwudgie! Whatever it was, this thing was impersonating his mother calling his name. It was trying to lure them possibly to their death!</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some strange and unusual animal anomalies. All of this and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives! If you have a story of your own that you would like to share with the guys you can email the show at expandedperspectives@yahoo.com or you can call the hotline at 817-945-3828.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about their Christmas break, Christmas, New Years Eve and all of the things that go with the holiday season. Then they start the news portion of the show off with an interesting sighting that took place near St. Jacob, Illinois. The person said that he was driving home on the highway early one morning when he saw what can only be described as a 7 foot tall stick insect! The man claimed “An object appeared in my headlights on the right side, crossing the highway, looking like a giant walking stick with four legs. Its head turned as it ran and looked at me just before going out of lighted view.”</p>
 <p>Then, a person who recently moved to a new house in woods had a terrifying encounter. The person grew up in a normal rural small town, but upon completion of high school they moved to a remote piece of property without any neighbors for miles. Over time the casual strolls through the nearby woods turned to terror, ending in being chased by some horrible looking creature! This thing was covered in hair, stood on two feet, had zero lips with giant sharp teeth.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some more tales of Time Slips! A time slip is an alleged paranormal phenomenon in which a person, or group of people, travel through time into the supernatural (rather than technological) means. As with all paranormal phenomena, the objective reality of such experiences is disputed. The Time Slip Theory works from the premise that time is fluid rather than fixed. Time is not linear as we experience it, but exists within a context of a single point of space. For some reason people from all over the world have brief experiences where they can see the past, the future or the same thing happen again and again like loop.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a man in northern Arkansas says he saw an unidentified bipedal creature standing next to the road. The 53 year old man who is a roofer by profession, said that he was heading back home after a day of work when he came upon the biped on November 15 of this year. The alleged creature was estimated to be 7 feet tall and weigh about 300 pounds. It also had something in it's hands like a leash or rope.</p>
 <p>Then, a person went camping up on the Mogollon Rim this summer just outside of Flagstaff, Arizona. They set up camp far from any other camp sites and well away from any roads or trails. They wanted to be completely alone with nature. Well, while camping in the remote wilderness they had an odd encounter one night when they awoke to something large and bipedal walking through their campsite. They also, noticed many game trails and lots of deer and elk bones in the area. Only later did they discover tales of the Mogollon Monster. The Mogollon Monster is described as bipedal and covered with hair everywhere but on the face, hands, feet, and chest. They report that the hair is “black or reddish brown,” and that it’s long.  The beast stands around 7 feet tall and has large eyes often said to be red. It also smells terrible, not unlike its other Bigfoot cousins.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some truly terrifying accounts of female serial killers. Since men perpetrate about 90 percent of the world’s homicides, it makes sense that nearly all of history’s most notorious serial killers are men. But they do have a small number of female counterparts, and they are just as deadly. All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a Wisconsin man claims he saw an unidentified creature he believed looked like a “pterodactyl”. The anonymous man said he and his father were driving home last August at about 2 p.m. when they came upon the creature. The eyewitness says the animal was approximately 6 feet tall and had “skin instead of feathers on its wings.”“Like a bat,” he said. “It looked like a pterodactyl or some kind of angel.”</p>
 <p>Then, a person claims that they stayed at a very strange Hampton Inn near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Over the course of 3 nights he had the same disturbing dream about the bathroom light coming on and a large black mass hovering over him while he and his wife slept. It was only months later that he discovered that his wife had seen the same strange thing.</p>
 <p>After the break, the boys have teamed up with Parcast, and on this episode they are releasing the first episode of the new podcast called "Assassinations". This first episode is about the tragic shooting of President John F. Kennedy. One death can change the world. At least, that's what assassins believe. Assassinations recounts history's most dramatic deaths.Through little-known facts, "what-ifs?" and examining assassin's motives, we examine how one murder can alter the course of history. A new episode releases every Monday. Assassinations is a production of Cutler Media and part of the Parcast Network. All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about their recent trip to the movie theater to see the thriller "Overlord". Then, a man who was driving home at night in Colorado saw something otherworldly hovering above the trees. The witness claimed that the lights rose higher and then got smaller and zig zagged eventually vanishing. A short time later he saw a strange creature with red fur, a tail and also had a human face.</p>
 <p>Then, the get things started in the news with a recent report that someone had while out hiking in the Cascades in Oregon. While out on a 15 day long hike through the woods, the person believed they were being followed by someone or something. Towards the end of the trip they physically saw what looked like a dark, hair, upright walking Ape.</p>
 <p>After the break, friend of the show Derek Hayes who runs the podcast "Monsters Among Us" sent in some audio clips from two of his listeners he thought we might enjoy. They tell a similar story that the guys have been reporting lately. Sightings of the "Glimmer Man" this time in the Northwest of the US. More and more people apparently are seeing what can only be described as a cloaked figure, who is somehow able to disturb and bend light around them. Is it sinister? Is if from Earth? Is it responsible for the thousands of missing people in our National Parks?</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a person in Grand Junction, Colorado had an encounter back in the summer of 2016 with an other worldly creature. This odd creature had tentacles and was rectangular in overall shape. What in the world were they seeing? Then, two men in Victoria say they came upon an “entity” they could not immediately identify. One of the eyewitnesses, who didn’t provide a name, said he and his friend were walking the streets of Harkaway when the purported being showed up. They claim that it was around 2 in the morning and when they rounded a corner of the street they were walking on they saw something large and glowing white.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up a very interesting email that one listener wrote in describing an encounter with something that resembled the Predator from the sci fi movie from the 80's. This being is able to cloak itself and if that is not strange enough, the guys have been getting more and more of these similar sightings. They have decided to call this perhaps new cryptid the "The Glimmer Man". All of this and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how Kyle recently went to Galveston, Texas to do some sport fishing with his twins and they had an amazing time catching bull redfish, sharks, sting rays and more. Then, a person tells a terrifying story of their sons imaginary friend who just might be a previous owner who died years before. This person was a Vietnam veteran who died of cancer and now lurks in their new home messing around with the new tenants. Then, a man in Texas claims to have seen a dinosaur bird. The anonymous San Benito man said he was at his father’s farm with his friends when the event purportedly took place in 2015. “We looked toward the south and witnessed a pterodactyl,” he told MUFON investigator L. Flechtner. “It was coasting along a ditch.” The animal was described as having a wingspan of 10 feet and looked like a pterosaur. Then, a person who was in the military and stationed in Germany had a strange encounter with what they described was a giant bird! Apparently this giant owl like creature had an estimated 8 foot wingspan!</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle and Cam talk with friend Seth Breedlove of Small Town Monsters about his latest creation "The Bray Road Beast". Seth Breedlove is a filmmaker. He has written, edited, produced and directed shorts and features about a variety of topics but is best known for his production company and the films they've produced under the Small Town Monsters banner. Before film, Seth wrote for a number of websites, newspapers and magazines and learned some of the skills he employs as a director while working as a reporter. Seth has also appeared on numerous television and radio programs. "The Bray Road Beast" is a movie about a hairy humanoid with canine features, the Beast of Bray Road, has been sighted in Wisconsin dating back to 1936 on a rural road outside of Elkhorn, Wisconsin. More recent sightings in the 1980s and 1990s, place the creature in Racine, Walworth and Jefferson Counties. Those who have seen the beast describe him as eating or hunting/scavenging.Also known as Manwolf, Bear-Wolf and Indigenous Dogman it is said to be around six feet tall with gray and brown fur. Its face resembles that of a wolf, with shiny yellow eyes and pointed ears. Its body, though furry, looks like a muscular man. The creature is said to run and walk on all four of its legs or just its hind legs and has been spied sitting on its haunches and kneeling like a man.Some people believe it is a werewolf, others that it is a Bigfoot and, and some believe that it is a yet unidentified species.Though it has never attacked anyone, some witnesses claim that it has acted aggressively, running at them and jumping on their vehicles.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve got something very special to share with you. Thanks to Audioboom, we are giving you an early sneak preview of one of their newest shows, it’s called “Dead Man Talking”. “Dead Man Talking” is an amazing podcast that  investigates the death row confessions of the famous Railroad Killer to see if he was lying in order to slow down his journey to the execution chamber or if was he even more sinister than anyone could have imagined. Angel Resendiz aka The Railroad Killer criss-crossed the US by freight train in the 80s and 90s, choosing his victims at random, before he was executed by the State of Texas in 2006. Before his death, Rezendiz spoke to journalist Alex Hannaford and claimed, on tape, to have killed more than he had taken the blame for. The authorities said Angel Resendiz was lying in an attempt to delay his own death. But, haunted by the crackly interview tape, Alex is determined to investigate. Then a letter arrives from a woman serving life in prison for her husband’s murder — telling him that Resendiz once confessed to that killing too.</p>
 <p>If you like true crime podcasts or just enjoy a good thriller then your going to like “Dead Man Talking” Enjoy the sneak preview and subscribe now wherever you find your favorite podcasts."</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>, the guys start the show off talking about Kyle's most recent baseball tournament. Well not his, his sons and their team The Texas Edge! Then, a guy named Kevin claims that one night back in October 4, 2011, he was driving down a dark lonely country road at around 2:00am in Wisconsin when we saw what looked like not one but two Pterodactyls. A flew along side of his car and were under 70 feet in the air. </p>
 <p>Then, a person near Warrensburg, New York claims that back on July 17, 2017 he was near Echo Lake meeting up with some friends drinking and having a good time. He was the first one there. Everything was eerily silent. You could have heard a pin drop. That's when something caught his attention. About 70 feet away is this humanoid creature. It was about 4-5 feet tall, skinny as hell, and naked. Also, a person from Canada tells a tale of seeing a large muscular slug like creature crawling out of a bog one night. The thing was about 5-6 feet long and 3 feet high and seemed to have it's own bioluminescence.</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up three cases of some truly disturbing haunted breweries. There are lots of encouraging numbers attached to the craft beer world these days. With more than 4,144 breweries in the country we have now surpassed the historic high of 4,131 breweries in 1873, and nearly 75 percent of drinking-age Americans live within 10 miles of a local brewery. One thing that is not mentioned, is all of the hauntings associated with some of these breweries. Listen as Cam breaks down a few of these iconic destinations if your brave enough to visit!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a man in northern Michigan released a photograph of an alleged Bigfoot creature. The man, who goes by the name of Jack, claims he was on a fishing trip when he came upon the seemingly bipedal animal, which he initially though to be a bear. He claimed it was about 6 foot tall and had a human like figure. He also claims that it made a high pitch growl and that he made momentary eye contact with the beast and they both just froze. Then, a Wisconsin man says he saw a Bigfoot creature in Barron County. Bob, who didn’t provide a last name, says that he was fishing in a lake when he spotted the monkey-like creature in plain daylight.</p>
 <p>Then, a person tells a deeply disturbing encounter one evening while walking in a cemetery in Rossville, Illinois. It took place between 2007 and 2010 and what they saw looked like a strange hairless humanoid like being. The thing circled them for minutes ducking behind tombstones but never really exposing itself to the witnesses. It projected a terrible feeling of dread and doom and whatever this thing was they knew it was up to no good.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle, brings up some strange encounters with the hairy beast simply known as Bigfoot. One of the cases discussed has become known as "The Siege of Honobia". Apparently, Bigfoots had been harassing a family who lived deep in the sticks in Honobia, Oklahoma for some time. The family had planted a lot of Austrian snow peas, a crop that deer loved to eat, so deer congregated on their property. The family then hunted the deer for food, mostly by spotlighting at night. They stored deer meet in a freezer in a shed outdoors. The Bigfoots were coming around the house mostly at night, attacking the house with rocks, banging on windows and doors, screaming and yelling, stealing deer meat from the freezer, damaging property, and just in general raising Hell. The family contacted law enforcement but were laughed off since Bigfoots don’t exist. Bigfoots had been seen by all family members on multiple occasions. All of this and more on this installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about a guy named Chris had a strange encounter with what could only be described as a werewolf on a deserted gravel road in rural Mississippi in 1986. Apparently sometime during the middle of December near Winona, Mississippi, Chris and his cousin Elizabeth were driving down a lonely country road trying to spot some deer when they spotted something far more disturbing. This thing was over 7 feet tall and looked like a werewolf. Then, Jeff a guy from Austin, Texas reveals a run in when he was a teenager with a dark figure that resembles the Hatman. Who, or what, is the Hat Man? Well, that’s a very good question. Put simply, an untold number of people, dating back to an untold period of time, have reported  encounters with what is clearly a malevolent entity with intentions that are not good – not in the slightest. On some occasions the Hat Man appears in shadowy form. On many occasions, however, the Hat Man appears in regular, human form, sporting a black beard and a black suit, and wearing a long overcoat or a cloak – almost always black, too.</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up the interesting tale of the Albino Farm. Those who grew up in and around Springfield, Missouri have probably heard of the legend surrounding that large piece of property--the legend of the albino farm.   The land, which was called Springlawn Farm, was first owned by the Headley Family and then the Sheedys.  It was a recreational destination for locals in the 1800's, and postcards were even made depicting the farm. But, according to local legend, the farm had a dark side.  It’s long been rumored that a caretaker at the farm had albinism and scared people off with a shotgun.  Other tales tell of experiments done on people with albinism in a rock mansion that used to be on the property.  Those stories were sometimes combined with the legend of the Hatchet Man’s Bridge, a narrow bridge near Springlawn Farm, on which it was said a car disappeared, and the driver’s body was later found beheaded with a bloody hatchet nearby.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about a girl recalls a very scary encounter her and a friend had when they were younger. While walking to a local convenience store at around 2:00am on the east side of Gallup, New Mexico on a reservation, something or someone strange began following them. If that wasn't scary enough, this strange person was running on all fours like a dog. Then, the Greenville News published a strange story on November 10, 1958 about a strange winged creature that spooked a driver named Charlie Wetzel. According to the paper, Wetzel, 24, a resident of nearby Bloomington, reported soberly that he was driving on a street near Riverside when a frightening creature jumped in front of his car. "It had a round, scarecrowish head," he said, "like something out of Halloween."It wasn't human. It had a longer arm than anything I'd ever seen. When it saw me in the car it reached all the way back to the windshield and began clawing at me."It didn't have any ears. The face was all round. The eyes were shining like something fluorescent and it had a protuberant mouth. It was scaley, like leaves."</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle gets into the troubling story simply known as "The Boy in the Box". Known also as “America’s Unknown Child”, the Boy in the Box murder has gone unsolved since the discovery of his body on  25 February 1957. A young muskrat hunter set out to check his traps, set near a park just north of Philadelphia. As he moved through the brush, he found a small cardboard box, lying discarded on the ground. Inside was the body of a boy, naked, but wrapped in a plaid blanket. Fearing that the police would confiscate his traps if he alerted them to the box, the young hunter ignored it, and resumed hunting. Several days later, a college student driving down the road noticed a bunny, running alongside the highway. The student knew there were traps in the area, and stopped to make sure the animal was safe. As he sifted through the underbrush searching for traps, he came across the box. Though he too feared interaction with the police, the student reported the body to them. Given that the boy was young, between three and seven years old, police were hopeful that he would be quickly identified. However, once they saw the body, their hopes were dashed. While people would surely be looking for a missing boy who was healthy, well cared for, and clearly loved, it was unlikely that they would be looking for a scrawny, dirty, malnourished one. Unfortunately, the boy in the box was just that. His hair was matted and seemed to have been recently cut as clumps of it still clung to his body. His body was severely malnourished and covered with surgical scars, most notably on his ankle, groin, and chin. Despite the fact that he looked abandoned, police fingerprinted him, hoping to find a match. Sadly, no one did.</p>
 <p>Who was this boy? How did he die? Who were his parents? All of this and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a New York couple couple claims they saw an unidentified humanoid. The man, who sent an anonymous report, said he and his fiancee were driving near Queensbury, New York when they spotted the strange figure last Sunday at about 12:15 a.m. Then, on July 15, 1942, six P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft and two B-17 Flying Fortress bombers encountered a blizzard while supporting the Allied war effort in the British Isles. The aircraft were forced to conduct an emergency landing on the glaciers of Greenland, and though all the crew members were rescued nine days later, the aircraft were left behind. Over the decades, the ever-shifting ice sheets of Greenland buried the aircraft, known as the Lost Squadron, under between 250 and 300 feet of ice. Fifty years later, in 1992, one of the P-38s was extracted from the ice and restored to flying condition: the infamous <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a18943/glacier-girl-p-38-fighter/"> Glacier Girl</a>.</p>
 <p>Then, a person claims that while he was laying in bed with his wife one night, he actually disappeared into another dimension. After the break Cam brings up some interesting cases of people who murdered another person while sleep walking. American history is littered with cases of sleepwalking killers – usually men who wake in the night and kill their wife or lover. The best-known historical case is that of Albert Tirrell, who, in 1845, killed his lover, Maria Bickford. They had been having an affair, and after being repeatedly caught by his wife’s family, he decided to kill Bickford and set fire to the building they were sleeping in – apparently to conceal the evidence of his crime. Unfortunately, the landlord was awoken by Bickford’s screams, and Tirrell was eventually caught and tried. He was acquitted of arson and murder, but found guilty of adultery. His defense was murder while sleep walking. This story and more on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how they along with the family are going to go see the new move "The Meg". They also, talk about "Shark Week" on the Discovery Channel. Then, two men in Missouri claim they saw an unidentified bipedal creature. The eyewitnesses said they were hunting in the woods when they came across the hairy being on November 24, 2017. Then, in July of 1878 the New York Times wrote an article titled “What a West Virginia Farmer Saw.” The article talked about a telegram that had come from a small town in Parkersburg, West Virginia and addressed to the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune in regards to a terrifying event witnessed by a couple of farmers early one evening.</p>
 <p>After the break the boys speak with personal friend Joshua Cutchin about his latest book "Thieves In The Night: A Brief History of Supernatural Child Abductions" Folklore has always warned of hidden dangers lurking in the shadows, otherworldly beings who seek to steal that which parents hold most dear. In the first book dedicated solely to the subject, Joshua Cutchin traces this primal concern from antiquity to the modern era—beginning with worldwide tales of faeries, changelings, spirits, demons, and monsters, before examining more contemporary phenomena such as Sasquatch kidnappings, alien abductions, and mysterious disappearances in national parks. Folklore, medicine, science, and spirituality come together for a uniquely scholarly perspective on the thieves in the night.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how Kyle's twins were recently nabbed by the local Police for climbing up on top of a nearby neighborhood church. They didn't get into any trouble but it did squash any hopes of becoming a professional at parkour. Then, researchers from Montreal’s National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS) just published <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/CACFD58E-DB1F-4F46-F76E48662D2EF957_394935/optica-5-7-779.pdf?da=1&amp;id=394935&amp;seq=0&amp;mobile=no">a study in <em>Optica</em></a> detailing a new approach to invisibility cloaking. Their device, called a spectral invisibility cloak, is the first to manipulate the color (or frequency) of the light waves that interact with an object, rendering it invisible.</p>
 <p>Then, a woman in Cleburne County, Arkansas says she saw a bipedal creature with a wolf head. The sighting happened back on June 15th, 2018. The woman said she was driving home in the daylight and need to stop along side the road in order to make a phone call. While using the phone she noticed something dark moving in the woods. What appeared was a large doglike creature walking upright on two legs. The sighting reportedly lasted about three minutes but the eyewitness said she was not able to snatch a photograph or video.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam talks about some very creepy haunted playgrounds. You've heard tales of haunted houses and amusement parks - but haunted playgrounds provide plenty of creepy stories as well. Playground ghost stories are made even eerier by the presence of ghostly children, who are rumored to drift through yards located at former insane asylums, abandoned schools, and even the middle of cemeteries. Swings that move on their own. Children's laughter echoing when there are no kids present. Ghostly apparitions. All are rumored to plague these creepy playgrounds. These sites are still standing, but remember that trespassing in closed areas is not a wise decision. Besides the criminal charges you may face, these scary playground stories warn of the chilling fate that could await you at the bottom of that slide.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about some bizarre sightings of what appears to be an upright walking canine with one of them being white. In 2009, in the area of Mt. Penn and Neversink Mountain, Berks County PA a witness returning home from work witnessed what he thought was a large dog squatting along the side of the road. He approached with caution as he thought the dog may run out onto the roadway and he didn't want to hit it, but as he approached the animal he noticed the lower legs were very large and not those of a dog. The animal stood up and it was not a dog but a large Bi-Pedal Canine, approx. 7 to 8 foot tall and standing on two legs.</p>
 <p>Then, an eyewitness, an older gentleman named 'John', stated that he had been at the Wilmore Reservoir in Cambria Pennsylvania on Friday June 1, 2018. He had been fishing on the lake and around dusk (between 8-8:30 pm) he noticed something in the edge of the nearby woods; a bipedal creature. As he focused on the being, he soon realized that it was white in color and that it resembled a <em>'wolf on two legs,</em> Then, they discuss a very disturbing alien abduction with several beings in someone's bedroom.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some very strange encounters with beings from another planet. These are not your everyday encounters with the Grey's. From blob monsters to space goblins and more, all on this episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a woman named Katie Holley, a Florida resident, woke up in the middle of the night to a weird sensation in her ear, "like someone had placed a chip of ice in my left earhole," she wrote in an essay published in <a href="https://www.self.com/story/live-roach-ear-sleeping">Self magazine</a>. At first, her husband tried to remove the invader with tweezers. But that strategy wasn't successful, so they went to the emergency room. There, the doctor confirmed her suspicion: A cockroach was in her ear canal. To get the insect out, he first killed it with lidocaine (a numbing agent) and then removed it using tweezers. But in the days that followed, Holley had soreness in her ear and trouble hearing. When she returned to the doctor nine days later, she learned that she still had pieces — including the entire head — of the roach lodged in her ear.</p>
 <p>Then, if a modern heart doctor could give medical advice to the iceman Ötzi — the man who was preserved as a mummy after his murder about 5,300 years ago in the snowy Alps — it would be this: Stop eating so much fatty meat and consider taking medications that lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. This advice is based on a new comprehensive look at the iceman mummy's cardiovascular health. A full-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed that Ötzi had three calcifications (hardened plaques) in his heart region, putting him at increased risk for a heart attack.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some strange mysteries surrounding the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail is one of America's most famous hiking paths. The massive journey spans close to 2,200 miles and runs from Maine to Georgia and is the longest hiking-only trail in the world. With that big of an impact on our culture and history, it's no wonder so many urban legends and scary stories are based around the trail. Much of the Appalachian Trail is desolate and remote, cutting through mountains and thick forests. And when you've been hiking for a few days, haven't seen civilization in a while, your mind can start to play tricks on you. Or maybe not. Maybe there really are unexplained incidents and creatures lurking in the woods.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking more about sparkling water or "Angry Water". What flavors they like and some that they don't. Then, Cam brings up an interesting story from war torn Afghanistan were some soldiers who had a run in with what can only be described as a Djinn or Demon. Then, could the Octopus and other Cephalopods be from other planet? Did their eggs remain frozen and travel from other parts of the galaxy to planet Earth millions of years ago?</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up a few ancient technologies that were ahead of their time. The ancient world proved that humans can never be stopped from progressing. Ancient cultures knew more about explaining the sun and stars in methods that the modern world can barely understand. Civilizations that existed for hundreds or thousands of years advanced and developed in ways that continue to amaze historians. Some of the technology that was created by ancient cultures still cannot be recreated today, and other inventions may have changed the course of human progression if they had not been lost.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about an interesting article that was recently published in the Scientific American about how new research now shows some flora can detect an herbivorous animal well before it launches an assault, letting a plant mount a preemptive defense that even works against other pest species. Scientist recently squirted snail slime—a lubricating mucus the animals ooze as they slide along—into soil, nearby tomato plants appeared to notice. They increased their levels of an enzyme called lipoxygenase, which is known to deter herbivores. So the question is "how smart are plants?" </p>
 <p>Then, an anonymous man, who wrote the message in Spanish, said he was walking home when he noticed the cigar-shaped object. Inside of this strange elongated object appeared to be what looked like a living entity. He tried to video tape the strange craft and creature but was unsuccessful. After the break Cam brings up the strange story of 14 detached feet that have washed ashore in southwest Canada and northwest United States. Who do they belong to? Where did they come from? And why only feet?</p>
 <p>Like nearly all of the 13 human feet that had mysteriously washed up on Canadian shores before it, the 14th foot appeared, unexpectedly, on the banks of the Salish Sea in British Columbia. This time, a man walking the beach on Gabriola Island discovered the appendage trapped in a mass of logs, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The law enforcement agency described the foot as “disarticulated” — that is to say, disconnected from the human body to which it had belonged. It did not specify if it was a left foot or a right foot. Curiously, Foot No. 14 was clad in a hiking boot; all but one of the others had been wearing athletic sneakers. So continues the mystery of the human feet floating ashore in the Pacific Northwest, a phenomenon that has captivated residents, scientists and area law enforcement since 2007. In August of that year, not one but two disembodied human feet, both right ones, were found on islands in the Salish Sea, a network of coastal waterways between Vancouver Island and Canada’s westernmost province. Over the past decade or so, 14 feet in all have washed ashore in British Columbia, of which eight have been identified as belonging to six people. The discoveries are frequent enough that the British Columbia Coroners Service even put together a map charting where each of the feet had been found. (Some other feet have appeared on American shores farther south, in Washington state.) Officials say there is a reasonable explanation for why so many of the feet have been found in sneakers: Namely, that the materials used to make modern-day running shoes allow the feet to remain buoyant after they become separated from the rest of the body in the sea.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about what they have been busy doing over the last couple of weeks before starting the news with a story about how a man and his daughter believe they saw a Bigfoot-like creature in Iosco County, Michigan. The man, whose name was not released by the BFRO, said they were walking to a detached garage near their home at 2:30 a.m. when they spotted the unidentified animal in October 2017. Then, a truck driver claims to have seen a large 7' tall Grey Alien like creature standing along side the road one early morning just outside of Casper, Wyoming.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some real life stories of children who have experienced what can only be called past life experiences or reincarnation. Reincarnation is a fascinating subject that has remained on the fringe of scientific study for too long. Fortunately, it has recently begun to attract serious interest from the scientific community. Decades ago, American astronomer and astrobiologist <a href="https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/267/2015/11/REI37.pdf">Carl Sagan stated</a> that “there are three claims in the [parapsychology] field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study,” with one being “that young children sometimes report details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any other way than reincarnation.” Fast forward to today, and amazing discoveries have been made, as multiple researchers have taken it upon themselves to study this intriguing and inexplicable — at least from a materialist scientific worldview — phenomenon. University of Virginia psychiatrist Jim Tucker is arguably the world’s leading researcher on this topic and so was his mentor Ian Stevenson.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about where they've been, The Ozark Mountain UFO Conference and Kyle surviving Dengue fever. Then, a person has an encounter with a group of tiny little people in the Rough River State park in Kentucky back in the summer of 2003. The witness was on a weekend canoeing trip for rest and relaxation in an remote area of Rough River State Park. He was strangely queasy and anxious for some unknown reason. for some unknown reason, he felt like he had something to fear. Heeding these sensations, he was extremely cautious on the river. After several miles he paddled the canoe to the riverbank and tied it off to a tree. He got out to explore the area. Looking 8-10 ft downstream he spotted what looked like the top of a gray clay jar peeking out of the water. Afterwards he not only heard them but saw them too.</p>
 <p>Then, at 2 AM on Sunday morning (AEST time) astronomers at the Steward Observatory Catalina Station in Arizona spotted an asteroid hurtling towards Earth at 106,497 km/h. Called 2018 GE3, it was estimated to be up to 110 meters in diameter, which is the same length as an average FIFA soccer field. Scientists quickly calculated that it would pass us the following day, but only just. And actually 2018 GE3 would turn out to be the largest known asteroid to ever drift so close to Earth, and this particular rock's first visit since 1930. The next day it tore past without incident, brushing within 192,317 km of our upper atmosphere. And sure, that sounds like a healthy margin for error, but keep in mind that space is infinite and the moon is just 400,000 kilometers away.</p>
 <p>After the break the guys speak with explorer, rock hound, researcher and author Chris Hegg about his book called "<em>T</em><em>he Ancient Universal Language of Man</em>". Chris's passion is petroglyphs and ancient language, growing up in a tiny desert remote town of 25 people depending on who passed away that year. His life spent wandering the hills alone since a young boy. Between rock hounding, exploring and prospecting Chris always came back to the fascination of petroglyphs and why they were there. Chris's first introduction to them was by an old Indian sheep herder woman that lived alone. She scared the boy with tales of red headed giants making them and how she had seen three of them when she was a girl living near his home! Chris was hooked forever more trying to crack the code of symbols but failed at every turn. Chris joined the Air Force and learned cryptology doing morse code. Once back home Chris started applying his new knowledge to the old problem and now 40 years later have finally made decipherments cracking important symbols. Not only that, Chris learned through his knowledge of geology that many major petroglyph sites are actually thirteen to sixteen thousand years old. After decades of leaping from state to state looking at panels the Internet and social media allowed Chris to connect with folks everywhere to see more sites and soon realized this language is global. It gets better because the final piece to the puzzle came when Chris recognized why the sites were where they were because of global trade using the ancient inland great lake systems!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a witness and her boyfriend along with her sister and her boyfriend had a strange encounter with something otherworldly. The unusual sighting took place more than once over the last couple of months on Vancouver Island in Canada. Apparently what they encountered looked like a large black winged humanoid, almost like the creature from Jeepers Creepers!</p>
 <p>Then, a California witness at Rancho Cordova reported watching a disc-shaped object hovering 20 feet above the ground while others in the area seemed not to notice, according to testimony in Case 83576 from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) witness reporting database. The witness and his fiancé were leaving a restaurant on Folsom Boulevard at Hazel Avenue when the incident began.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some of the mysteries surrounding Plum Island. Sitting just off New York’s Long Island sitting in Gardiner’s Bay is a tiny speck of land measuring only 3 miles (4.8 km) long and 1-mile (1.6 km) wide, known as Plum Island. It is mostly a nondescript and unassuming little piece of rocky land that most would normally not give much thought to, but Plum island is wreathed in a colorful history shrouded in secrecy and mystery. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Tiangong -1 is no more. <a href="https://www.space.com/40076-chinese-space-station-crash-to-earth-guide.html">China's prototype space station</a>, whose name translates as "Heavenly Palace 1," met a fiery end in Earth's atmosphere, breaking apart and burning up in the skies over the southern Pacific Ocean at about 8:16 p.m. EDT (0016 April 2 GMT), according to the U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Force Space Component Command (JFSCC). <a href="https://www.space.com/27320-tiangong-1.html">Tiangong-1</a> was about 34 feet long by 11 feet wide (10.4 by 3.4 meters), and it weighed more than 9 tons (8 metric tons). The space lab consisted of two main parts: an "experimental module" that housed visiting astronauts and a "resource module" that accommodated Tiangong-1's solar-energy and propulsion systems.</p>
 <p>Then, a man in Cleburne County, Arkansas says he and his friend came across a humanoid with a “wolf head”. Technician Chris Branch said that his next door neighbor was the one to actually see the creature back in February. The man specified a location but it will remain undisclosed in this report due to privacy reasons. Apparently this beast wasn’t a bear or a dog, it was more of a body builder with a wolf head”. Then, a woman and her boyfriend saw what looked like a giant flying humanoid fly right by their vehicle back in December 2017 in a rural area of Quebec. She claims the winged monster looked like the guy from the hit movie Jeepers Creepers!</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle talks about some fascinating stories in a new book about Truck Drivers and their paranormal experiences called "Trucker Ghost Stories" by Annie Wilder. All of this and more on this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about lousy continuing education courses and the thrills of installing a new hot water heater. Then, the talk about how a woman who was living at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas back in 1971 had a terrifying encounter with an 8' to 9' foot black, winged creature with glowing red eyes one night. It appeared at the end of her bed while she was sleeping. Then, a person from Perryopolis, Pennsylvania wrote in to Lon Strickler for a friend who claims that there are eight-feet tall creatures resembling a Reptilian-type creature surrounding his house at night. They get into his head and communicate strange things like stuff about end of civilization stuff and that only a small group will survive. Sometimes they get physical and then there is loss of consciousness.</p>
 <p>Then, Kyle reads a newspaper article from the September 12th, 1880 edition of the New York Times. The article goes on to tell a mass sighting by many people on Coney Island who witnessed a man with frog like legs and bat like wings flying towards New Jersey at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The odd looking man was seen weeks before in St. Louis and again over the state of Kentucky. After the break Cam brings up the interesting life and death of Marilyn Monroe. In the early hours of Aug. 5, 1962, Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her bedroom in Brentwood, California. Following an investigation, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office ruled Monroe’s death a probable suicide. A toxicology report released shortly after revealed that the actress had taken a lethal dose of acute barbiturate poison. In the 55 years since, Monroe’s on-screen legacy has lived alongside several conspiracy theories about why and how she died. Her rumored close ties to the Kennedy family plays a large role in these theories, along with Monroe’s history of mental illness and drug abuse.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspective</em>s the guys start the show off talking about how a guy from Oneida, New York says he spotted a humanoid with a “wolf head”. The 16-year-old eyewitness, an Native American provided his identity but was kept anonymous as per the standard code of journalism ethics regarding disclosure of the identity of a minor, said that he was on his neighbor’s property looking for wild berries in the summer of 2017 when he encountered the creature at around 4:30 p.m. Then, a person claims that when they were in central Florida about 6 years ago they witnessed something truly bizarre. What they saw appeared to be real life Dragons!</p>
 <p>Then, a person claims that back on February 15, 2018 the spotted what can only be described as a giant red eyed human bat at a Zion, Illinois truck stop. The witness states that he stopped at the TA truck stop and spent about roughly 10 minutes inside the store. The witness got in his car and started headed back toward the highway when he saw what looked like a large winged humanoid. He stated that the encounter did not last very long and that during the encounter he saw a large humanoid figure that was solid black with a large pair of wings. The creature was hunched over and appear to be looking at something on the ground when the witness pulled up. The witness says that when he illuminated the creature, it looked up. Then the witness says that the creature took a couple of steps away from him and started flapping its wings and took off into the air.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some strange encounters while people were out camping. Camping in the woods is a surefire way to have fun with families and friends, but when the night falls, that's when the creepy, eerie, and scary stuff begins. From hearing a strange noise outside to seeing an unfamiliar figure in the woods, we have all experienced the haunting darkness that causes us to cling onto our sleeping bags and study shadows from the safety of our tents. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[What's In The Shadows <p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Elite the guys start the show off talking about how the idea that you could be vacationing in space someday may seem like a wild fantasy. But a space hotel could happen sooner than you think. Spaceflight company Bigelow Space Operations (BSO) wants to sell hotel reservations to give space enthusiasts—or scientists on a budget—a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The company is a spin off of Bigelow Aerospace, a Las Vegas-based company founded by billionaire Robert Bigelow that manufactures space habitats.Its plans are to launch two inflatable modules, called B330-1 and B330-2, each about 55 feet long once deployed, into low Earth orbit, around 250 miles above Earth. The two modules would be connected together to create a private station capable of housing up to six people for periods of time.</p>
 <p>Then, a Middlesex County resident in Massachusetts says he saw a “transparent” bipedal creature he was unable to identify. He and his wife were driving on Squannacook Road when they encountered the two-legged being. “We were returning from a Christmas party a few years ago,” he said. “It was about 11 p.m., we were driving approximately 10 mph down a dark road near our home. I focused on something that appeared to be walking across the road.”</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very strange reports of Shadow Creatures. What are they? Where are they from and What do they Want? All of this and more on this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives Elite!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how Earth's magnetic field is in a state of dramatic weakening – and according to mind-boggling new research, this phenomenal disruption is part of a pattern lasting for over 1,000 <a href="http://years.Earth">years.Earth</a>'s magnetic field doesn't just give us our north and south poles; it's also what protects us from solar winds and cosmic radiation – but this invisible force field is rapidly weakening, to the point scientists think it could actually flip, with our magnetic poles reversing. Then, researchers have uncovered a stunning archaeological find hidden by the waves lapping the Florida coastline: a 7,000-year-old Native American burial site preserved underwater since prehistoric times. The ancient resting place serves as a reminder the stretched Florida peninsula wasn't always as it is today. Millennia ago in a cooler climate, Native Americans lived and died on a broader, greater landmass, before rising seas swept their homes into history.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the interesting life and times of famous outlaw Billy the Kid. Billy the Kid was easily the most notorious desperado of the Wild West. He reportedly killed 21 men, one for every year of his young life.  History tells us that “The Kid” was born William Bonney in New York City in 1859.  He later fought against rich ranchers in the Lincoln County Cattle War in New Mexico, and was given a death sentence for killing Sheriff William Brady. Who is buried in Billy the Kid’s grave. According to most sources, Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett was eager to collect the $500 dollar bounty on Billy the Kid.  In July of 1881, he tracked down Billy in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, and killed him. History also tells us that Billy was buried the following day in a simple grave.  But now some people say that history is wrong.  That Billy wasn’t the man in that grave. Sixty-eight years after Billy’s death, a man from Texas, named “Brushy Bill” Roberts, claimed he was Billy the Kid. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a guy saw a large winged Gargoyle on his grandmothers ranch in rural Nevada back in 2005! The 7' tall beast was near his grandmother's chicken koop only 15' away. Then, a California woman who says she saw Bigfoot is suing the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife and the state's Natural Resources Agency for failing to keep citizens safe from the Sasquatch scourge. The <a href="https://www.pe.com/2018/02/12/crestline-woman-says-she-saw-sasquatches-in-lake-arrowhead-sues-state-to-get-species-recognized/"> Riverside Press-Enterprise reports</a> Claudia Ackley of Crestline filed the lawsuit in San Bernardino Superior Court on Jan. 18, spurred by her alleged encounter with multiple Sasquatches. Ackley, who is described as a "Bigfoot enthusiast and researcher," says she and her daughters saw three Sasquatches on a dusk hike at Lake Arrowhead last year.</p>
 <p>After the break the guys talk with the Seven Ages Research Associates. The Seven Ages Research Associates are a team whose shared interests in history, archaeology, science, and culture bring us to fascinating places. Our collective experience relies on fields of study that include environmental science, geology, archaeology, historical research, media and video production, and other areas that combine to present information and content that is both accessible, but also disciplined and reliant on scholarly source material.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p> </p>
 <p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a guy named Mike up in northern Wisconsin back in 1964 was out scouting an area to do some future camping when he saw a small bear. It turns out it was no bear, it was a baby Sasquatch. Then, the strange sightings of some unknown winged beast continues in and near the city of Chicago, this time in Forest Park. According to the eye witness, it was seen with glowing red eyes and began flapping it's wings as it ascended.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Mexican archaeologists have discovered a 2,400-year-old burial site in which 10 skeletons were meticulously placed in a circular formation and with their body parts interlocked. The researchers have never seen anything like it, with signs pointing to a previously unknown ritualistic practice. The skeletons were arranged in a spiral formation around a concentric point—as if to suggest the bodies were moving around a central figure like a wheel. Each body was placed on its side, and with arm bones interlocked. It’s not immediately clear if the people died from natural causes, some kind of group-wide calamity, or if they were deliberately killed. Though the exact purpose or reason for the grave is unknown, the researchers suspect it was part of an elaborate ritual.</p>
 <p>Then, Raautavaara resident Iisakki Mieto claims he was chopping firewood next to his house when he came upon the two beings on Dec. 21, 2017. The two huge beings appeared to be two large Neanderthal's haunched over and walking around on his property. Neanderthals were a species of humans believed to have gone extinct about 40,000 years ago. Some people, such as a state trooper from Washington who claimed to feed ape-like animals many refer to as Bigfoot, believe the cryptid could be some sort of “primitive human species”.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some strange and unusual encounters with the paranormal experienced by those in law enforcement! These stories are intriguing, and seem to have a little more credibility than the average onlooker, because the police are trained observers. These accounts shed light onto what happens when the men and women of the law come face to face with mysterious forces they have not been trained to deal with, and illustrate that they are only human, and just as susceptible to being unsettled by such phenomena as anyone else.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how the story of human migration is undergoing a dramatic revision. Once, archaeologists believed that <em>Homo sapiens </em>journeyed from this origin point and outwards to Europe and Asia about 60,000 years ago. But that tidy story no longer holds up. As evidence accumulates that the history of human origins and development was much messier, with <em>H. sapiens</em> overlapping and interbreeding with other hominins, the concept of a single great migration from Africa is also losing ground. Then, a woman has a glitch in time one night while driving.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the strange legend of the Victorio Peak Treasure. Victorio Peak, a craggy outcropping of rock barely five hundred feet tall, lies in the center of a dry desert lake known as the Hembrillo Basin. Beyond the Hembrillo Basin is a hundred mile stretch of desert known as the Jornada del Muerto. Victorio Peak, located in northern Dona Ana County, now lies within the White Sands Missile Range in south central New Mexico. However, long before Victorio Peak was encompassed by the government, a man by the name of Milton Ernest “Doc” Noss spent some time exploring Victorio Peak while on a deer hunt. Inside he found a hoard of treasure including coins, jewels, saddles and priceless artifacts including a gold statue of the Virgin Mary. He also found some old letters, the most recent of which was dated 1880. This treasure was only the beginning. In a deeper cavern, Doc found what he thought was a stack of worthless iron bars. He estimated there were thousands of these bars, each weighing over forty pounds stacked against a wall. He was barely able to lift one, much less think of carrying it back to the surface. Later, the wealth in the cave would be calculated to be worth more than two billion dollars. But he would never obtain all of the treasure, it seems that the government swooped in and took it all. Others claim it was a giant hoax!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a woman in Portugal claims she and her sister saw two Neanderthals back in 1939 in a very remote area. They encountered two naked man like creatures speaking a foreign tongue and living in a tiny cave. Then, a man claims he saw a Pterosaur like being flying over his parents car one summer night while driving to the grocery store.</p>
 <p>Then after the break Kyle brings up the bizarre missing person case about a man named Keith Reinhard. During the summer of 1988, journalist Keith Reinhard took a three-month leave of absence from his job and moved to the tiny Colorado mountain town of Silver Plume to write, reflect, and regenerate. With his 50th birthday approaching, Keith was determined to recapture his youth, overcome his fear of heights, and begin writing a novel. Keith Reinhard was fascinated with the history of Silver Plume - a former mining town haunted by a century-old pattern of bizarre disappearances and death. Reinhard became obsessed with the mysterious disappearance of Tom Young, another Silver Plume resident who vanished the year prior.  Young had occupied the same storefront that Keith now operated.   Working within these same walls, Tom Young became the basis of Reinhard's novel. At 5 PM on August 7, 1988, Keith closed up his shop for the day, telling friends that he was hiking to the top of nearby Pendleton Mountain - a hike Reinhard knew would take at least six hours. He never returned! Despite one of Colorado's largest land and air search missions, no trace of Keith Reinhard has ever been found. Today, the truth behind Keith Reinhard's mysterious disappearance is still fiercely debated:  Did the disappearance of Tom Young have any relationship to his own?  Is it possible Keith set up his own disappearance? Did he commit suicide?  Was he murdered?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Russian bases in Syria have been subjected to a series of mysterious attacks - including one conducted by a swarm of armed miniature drones - with military chiefs unable to establish who is behind the raids. The Russian Ministry of Defence said on Monday its military was able to capture three of the “small-sized air targets of unknown identity”. Seven were shot down and the remaining three exploded after crashing nearby on the night of 5 January. There were no casualties or damage to the base, a statement issued by the ministry said. It said it was the first time “terrorists” had used a “massed drone aircraft attack launched at a range of more than 50km using a modern GPS guidance system". Then, a man in Pennsylvania something very strange while out riding his quad in the summer of 2016. What he saw was a giant out of place bird.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the interesting question "<em>Is bigfoot physical or perhaps from another planet or even dimension</em>?" Has Bigfoot truly been able to elude man for hundreds of years, or might this creature's appearance be due to some portal and/or connection with another dimension? If inter dimensional, this may explain its comings and goings, appearances and disappearances, and its extraordinary (almost uncanny) ability to avoid man.  Or is Bigfoot an Extra-Terrestrial? In 1973, Pennsylvanian UFO researcher Stan Gordon noticed an increase in sightings of sasquatches entering and exiting the extraterrestrial vessels. So the question is "<em>Are they connected</em>?"</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of Expanded Perspectives is made possible by <a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/expanded"><em>Dollar Shave Club</em></a>! This week the guys start the show off talking about how in the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find. Which was how the Pentagon wanted it. For years, the program investigated reports of unidentified flying objects, according to Defense Department officials, interviews with program participants and records obtained by The New York Times. It was run by a military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo, on the fifth floor of the Pentagon’s C Ring, deep within the building’s maze. The Defense Department has never before acknowledged the existence of the program, which it says it shut down in 2012. But its backers say that, while the Pentagon ended funding for the effort at that time, the program remains in existence. For the past five years, they say, officials with the program have continued to investigate episodes brought to them by service members, while also carrying out their other Defense Department duties.</p>
 <p>Then, a person witnesses what can only be described as a group of yoked, commando, reptilians that invaded their neighborhood. After the break Kyle brings up some more stories about the Grinning Man. Eyewitnesses claim that the Grinning Man is a looming figure who stands well over 6-feet tall. His head is said to be devoid of any hair and his dark, beady eyes are nestled unnaturally far apart in his domed skull. Some observers are so perturbed that they are later unable to recall whether he even had a nose or ears, but — as disturbing as that may be — far and away his most disconcerting characteristic is the wide, hideous, shark-like grin that is perpetually plastered across his face.</p>
 <p>Renowned paranormal investigator and “Mothman Prophecies” author, John Keel, is considered to be the first researcher to mention the creature (or, more likely than not, <em>creatures</em>) that have collectively come to be known as the Grinning Man. In his seminal tome on unnatural entities, “The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings,” Keel discusses what is believed to be the first modern run-in with this peculiar entity, but it certainly wasn't the last. All of this and more on this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Elon Musk has once again warned about the dangers of unchecked artificial intelligence, this time in response to a viral video of a robot doing amazing acrobatic feats. Someone recently posted a clip of a Boston Dynamics humanoid robot called Atlas doing a backflip on Twitter. In reply, Musk wrote, "This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you'll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams." Then, a professional welder in Canada claims he saw a creature that looked just like the Loch Ness Monster. He said he was driving on the highway by Lake Nipissing when he spotted the dinosaur-like creature.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam talks about some strange sightings one of his friends had while deer hunting in Texas. Apparently, over the years he has had not one, but three encounters with tiny humanoids that looked like small Native American hunters. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a man in Maury County says he saw an unidentified bird he believes could be a Thunderbird. Then, a woman believes that her and her daughter hit what can only be described as a Ghost Deer on night while driving home in rural Maine. Then, people were fermenting grapes into wine about 8,000 years ago in what is now the Republic of Georgia, say scientists who found what's now considered the oldest known winemaking site on record. Archaeologists found ceramic jars that showed evidence of winemaking during an excavation of two Neolithic sites called Gadachrili Gora and Shulaveris Gora, which are in the South Caucasus, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. Previously, the oldest evidence of winemaking was found in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, and dated to between 5500 B.C. and 5000 B.C. The new discovery, dated to 6000 B.C., shows that people were enjoying the alcoholic drink a good 600 to 1,000 years longer than formerly thought. Then, a woman has a bizarre encounter with a UFO in Alabama back in 1983.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some unusual sightings of the Bogeyman and talks about some legends of the being from other parts of the world. The Bogeyman is there is to ensure that we follow the rules. It shapeless so it can be anywhere at any time, whether that means lurking under the bed or in the closet or behind a tree in the forest. It gets its power from the persistence of folklore. The transmission of these types of tales--those records of beliefs and customs and experiences--generates the guidelines for a lasting social code. This oral exchange educates on and reinforces the expectations for members of the community. Folktales are local to the people who tell them and reveal much about their perceptions of the world around them.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how two women want you to experience the Betty and Barney Hill Alien Abduction first hand through the power of Virtual Reality. Wexler, a writer and producer whose works include a book about the last mass lynching in the United States, came across the Hills' abduction while researching another project with her writing partner, Charlotte Stoudt, whose writing and producing credits include <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Homeland</em>. The two were immediately drawn to the story not only for its supernatural appeal but also because of the real-world parallels with racial tensions in the United States today. Wexler says the story was the perfect fit for virtual reality, which has been repeatedly referred to as the empathy machine for its ability to put the user in another's shoes. In its current form, <em>Dinner Party</em> is a two-part VR experience. In the opening scene, the audience is transported to the Hills' home. The couple entertains guests and prepares the dining room table for dinner until Betty interrupts the festivities with a surprise. She's decided to play the couple's hypnosis tapes for the first time. From there, the viewer is transported to the car on the night of the abduction and experiences the alien encounter as the Hills recalled it. Then, a man from Riverside California tells a strange encounter he and a friend had back in 1988 where they watched a girl transform into a giant insect.</p>
 <p>Then, in a study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, the scientists showed for the first time how our internal body clocks regulate wound healing by skin cells, and optimize healing during the day. Burns that happened at night took an average of 60 percent longer to heal than burns that occurred during the day, the scientists found. Night-time burns - sustained between 8pm to 8am - were 95 percent healed after an average of 28 days, compared with only 17 days if the burn happened between 8am and 8pm. Body clocks – known as circadian rhythms – regulate almost every cell in the body, driving 24-hour cycles in many processes such as sleeping, hormone secretion and metabolism. The key to accelerated daytime wound healing, the scientists found, was that skin cells moved more rapidly to repair the wound and there was also more collagen – the main structural protein in skin – deposited around the wound site. Then, a family in Pennsylvania tells of strange encounter with a cloaked, predator like being in the woods.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how in a stunning agricultural breakthrough, Chinese researchers have stated that they have developed a system for growing rice in saltwater. It's a revolutionary breakthrough that could help feed over 200 million people and boost China's rice production by 20 percent. Then, you Might want to hold off on eating that candy this Halloween! Of the 164 California Department of Public Health food contamination alerts issued over 14 years, 42 percent were for lead in candy. Nearly all of that candy was imported from countries like China, India, and Mexico. This accounts for a higher percentage of food contamination reports than <em>Salmonella, E. coli</em>, and botulism combined.</p>
 <p>Then, a commercial airline passenger on a flight from Toronto to Edmonton spotted a strange bright object appearing to be at the same altitude. He took pictures with a Galaxy S8+ cell phone before the object flew off to the east. The witness submitted the UFO report to the Mutual UFO Network (<a href="http://www.mufon.com/">MUFON</a>) on October 24, 2017, and says the sighting took place on October 19 at around 4pm. The witness says the path of the flight took the aircraft over the U.S. border and he estimates they were over Minnesota when he spotted the object. Then, a man tells of a terrifying encounter he had one day while out bowhunting in rural Mississippi with what can only be described as a Werewolf! After the break, Kyle tells 4 incredible stories of people and their encounters with an invisible presence that helped them out! All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how President Trump announced on Twitter that he will allow the release of thousands of classified documents about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy after years of delays. The unexpected move means the trove of never-before-seen documents are set to be released by the National Archives by Oct. 26. Then, Lon Strickler over at <a href="http://www.phantomsandmonsters.com"><em>Phantoms and Monsters</em></a> posted a very interesting encounter someone had when they were young with an alien in the basement of their school near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
 <p>Then, starting back in June of this year, many women and small girls have been plagued by a hair cutting ghost! Authorities have received dozens of similar reports from across the region. Police started getting calls about the strange attacks and at the same time, social media posts added to the furor. Rumors spread like wildfire and a weird panic set in throughout several villages. Many citizens believe that a group practicing black magic is involved. These evil magical practitioners purportedly have the ability to shape-shift. It's said they gain their powers by cutting the hair of unsuspecting females. Then, a Pennsylvania witness at Homer City reported being woken by the sound of a military helicopter and then saw a triangle-shaped object that seemed to cause a loss of time.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very strange stories of gigantic snakes being seen and worshiped in the southwest United States. Apparently there are many tales and legends along with cave paintings of giant snakes in and around the Roswell, New Mexico. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Google revealed a pair of wireless headphones, but not just any wireless headphones, but ones containing built in language translation software with the ability to translate between 40 different languages — in real time. Then, back on August 25, 2017, a man and his wife were driving through New Mexico when they had an encounter with two tiny green colored beings piloting a convertible UFO. Then, two guys back in June of 2014 had a very odd run in with what can only be described as a white bird like humanoid in rural South Dakota.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some very strange real life encounters with what is know as The Third Man Effect! In case you don't know, the Third Man Effect involves a strong impression of a felt presence, sometimes with a voice or a shadow-like image, but often without a clear form. Extreme physical conditions, threat to life, and social isolation all seem to trigger the feeling of a presence, which will often feel as if it has a spiritual or guiding purpose. In the case of the third man, it is tempting to think that strong feelings of presence act as some sort of hallucinatory defence mechanism – something that could happen to anyone, but only in very extreme scenarios. Such experiences are, however, also reported in much less dramatic circumstances. Following bereavement, for example, many people report sensing the presence of their deceased loved one; a feeling that someone is still in the house, just upstairs, or in their favorite chair. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a half-decomposed arm was found on the shores of County Clare on the western shores of Ireland. The individual who discovered the limb believed it might be human and notified authorities. Law enforcement ascertained that the arm belonged to an animal and passed it on to Frankie Coote, the Clare County Council Dog Warden, who apparently is the only animal expert around. Then, a woman claims that several of here friends and family have seen her working at the mall. The only problem is, she doesn't work at the mall. Could they have seen her Doppelgänger?</p>
 <p>Then, another sighting of a strange bat like creature has been seen again in the Little Village area of Chicago. This will be the 6th sighting in just the last few weeks. Then, a New Mexico witness at Pojoaque reported watching a bright green, disc-shaped object less than 100 feet off the ground. After the break Cam brings up the strange connection with Jack Parsons and the Occult. All of this and more on this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about how a person recently reported to Lon Strickler over at <a href="http://www.phantomsandmonsters.com"><em>Phantoms and Monster</em>s</a> about a Gollum like creature they witnessed one night feeding on their horse. Then, two more sightings of this black, bat winged entity has been seen in the Little Village area of Chicago. Then, a robot inspired by a hitchhiking fish can cling to surfaces underwater with a force 340 times its own weight. The new bot was inspired by the remora, fish that cling to larger marine animals like sharks and whales, feeding off their hosts' dead skin and feces. Remora fish do this with a specially adapted fin on their undersides called a suction disc, which consists of a soft, circular "lip" and linear rows of tissue called lamellae. The lamellae sport tiny, needle-like spinules. The remora can use tiny muscles around the disc to change its shape to suction itself to the host; the spinules then provide major gripping power by adding friction to the equation. After the break Cam brings up some unusual anomalies on and around a mysterious mountain in Africa. All of this and more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives. </em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> we put an end to summer by talking about some strange and unusual mysteries that surround the islands of Hawaii. But first we start with the news where Cam brings up how a freelance photographer Randy Lathrop was riding his bicycle up and down Indian River Drive Monday morning like he does every week when he discovered something extremely unique. Left lying on the bank of the Indian River in Brevard County, among all the debris and displaced items left behind by Hurricane Irma, was a piece of history in the form of some sort of ancient canoe. Then, a guy from New Jersey calls into Coast to Coast with a bizarre incident that happened to his brother one night while fishing in Florida.</p>
 <p>Then, two women in Florida claim they saw an unidentified bipedal creature. The two sisters said they were driving in daylight north of Cedar Key one week after hurricane Hermine on September 11, 2016 when they spotted the bigfoot-like creature crossing the highway. The surrounding area was reportedly flooded with standing water as a result of the hurricane. Finally, a California burger chain is installing a new robot as a replacement short-order cook. CaliBurger hired a robot dubbed "Flippy" at the joint's Pasadena location. Creators at Miso Robotics call Flippy a "kitchen assistant," meaning chefs and cooks will collaborate with the robot. The robot uses cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to see what it's cooking. Once a burger is cooked, Flippy picks it up and puts it on the bun. All of this and more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how researchers writing in the journal <em>Science</em> this week are warning us about yet another ecological issue caused by us resource-hogging humans: sand extraction. It’s hard to limit people’s sand use. As human demand for and use of natural resources has grown, sand and gravel have become the “most extracted group of materials worldwide.” Then, a number of hotels have begun offering in-room fish-for-rent service. The latest to join the admittedly modest trend is the Van der Valk Hotel Charleroi Airport in Brussels, where a photo of one of the room companions—just €3.50 per night—recently took off on social media.</p>
 <p>Then, a guy named Sonny in Peoria, Illinois recently called into Coast to Coast to tell of a Bigfoot sighting he had back in 1969. Apparently the large beast chased him and his two brothers out of the woods. Then, the cave systems underneath the Antarctic ice could be home to an “exciting new world” of plants and animals. After analyzing DNA retrieved from a cave system underneath the Ross Island volcano Mount Erebus, scientists at the Australia National University found samples that could not be fully identified—pointing to the presence of unidentified species living in the subglacial terrains. After the break Cam brings up the mostly unknown story of Jesus in Japan. On the flat top of a steep hill in a distant corner of northern Japan lies the tomb of an itinerant shepherd who, two millennia ago, settled down there to grow garlic. He fell in love with a farmer’s daughter named Miyuko, fathered three kids and died at the ripe old age of 106. In the mountain hamlet of Shingo, he’s remembered by the name Daitenku Taro Jurai. The rest of the world knows him as Jesus Christ. It turns out that Jesus of Nazareth—the Messiah, worker of miracles and spiritual figurehead for one of the world’s foremost religions—did not die on the cross at Calvary, as widely reported. According to amusing local folklore, that was his kid brother, Isukiri, whose severed ear was interred in an adjacent burial mound in Japan. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about their recent disc golf outing and some interesting news items. First off, a woman from Ferry county claims she saw a primate she identified as a Bigfoot. The anonymous 60-year-old woman says she was by Empire Creek road near Malo, Washington when the creature showed up. Then, astronaut Peggy Whitson returns to Earth after nine and a half months in space. She’s broken record after record–most significantly that at a total of 665 days, she’s spent the most time in space of any woman and any American astronaut. At age 57, she’s also the world’s oldest female astronaut.</p>
 <p>Then, a couple in Ormond by the Sea, Florida reports that they saw a bright object flying “zig-zaggy” through the sky at a high rate of speed. The sighting took place last night as they were watching the stars from their backyard. Then, <a href="https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/1">Breakthrough Listen</a>, a $100 million initiative aimed at stepping up the search for alien signals, says it’s picked up an intriguing series of 15 fast radio bursts emanating from a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years away. It’s way too early to claim that the signals from the galaxy, which hosts a radio source known as FRB 121102, constitute the kind of evidence sought for decades by researchers specializing in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some incredible tales of Giants that once live on Catalina Island, just off the California coast. All of this and more on this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on <em>Expanded Perspectives</em> the guys start the show off talking about the recent floods in Houston and then, how on several occasions in 1975, Yugoslav Air Force jets saw a strange multi-colored glowing orb, but every time they tried to investigate, it would outrun their jet fighters. Finally, after failed attempts to get a closer look, and facing ridicule for reporting the incidents, they chose to ignore it. Then, a bizarre encounter with Sasquatch and the crazy story of "The Phantom of Spreyton". Then, Talia Rappa and Skyer Ashworth turned summer bargain shopping at a Titusville Thrift store closeout into the stuff of NASA collectors' legends when the central Florida college students paid 20 cents each for five rare NASA flight suits that experts say could be valued at $5,000 apiece or more. </p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up some people who disappeared under very unusual circumstances. Back in the Dark Ages, people disappeared all the time. Crusades, disease and nearly nonexistent bookkeeping made it easy to slip through the cracks without so much as a footprint left behind. Luckily, the modern world makes such disappearances damn near impossible -- when people vanish, it usually turns out they were killed or kidnapped, or at least they were very likely to have been. The point is, usually we have some kind of an answer. Which makes it all the more mind-boggling when people actually <em>do</em> vanish into thin air, under very weird circumstances. All of this and more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how there was apparently a wave of some very strange sightings of what appeared to be Pterodactyls over the English countryside back in 1982-1983. Then, from mid-September onward, solar panels will be mandatory for new homes in South Miami, Florida. The law — which was passed with a four-to-one majority — states that builders <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbawen/south-miami-is-now-the-first-city-in-florida-to-require-solar-panels-on-new-homes">must install</a> 16 m² (175 ft²) of solar panel per 93 m² (1000 ft²) of sunlit roof area, or one panel with a 2.75 kilowatt capacity per 93 m² (1000 ft²) of living space; the rule also extends to some renovations.</p>
 <p>Then, Steven Petrow over at the Washington Posts recently wrote an article about his dying mother seeing ghosts or spirits of dead relatives. Apparently this is very frequent and common among those about to transition to the other side. Then, new research finds that people who think they are less active than others in a similar age bracket die younger than those who believe they are more active—even if their actual activity levels are similar.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up Vile Vortices. By definition, the Vile Vortices would be miserable whirlers but actually they are twelve vertex points of a planetary grid (see Figure 1) originally plotted by Ivan T. Sanderson, a naturalist and paranormal investigator. Sanderson first coined the term, “Vile Vortices”1 in his article “The Twelve Devil’s Graveyards Around the World” (Saga magazine, 1972). The best-known Vile Vortices are the <a href="http://www.paranormal-encyclopedia.com/b/bermuda-triangle/">Bermuda Triangle</a>, the <a href="http://www.paranormal-encyclopedia.com/d/dragons-triangle/">Dragon’s Triangle</a> (Devil's Sea), and the <a href="http://www.paranormal-encyclopedia.com/s/south-atlantic-anomaly/">South Atlantic Anomaly</a>. However, each of these twelve geographic areas is credited with instances of magnetic anomalies and other unexplained phenomena.</p>
 <p>All of this and more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how a 20 year old woman in Michigan came across a truly horrifying beast while driving. The creature she described looked like it had the body of a man and the head of a dog. Then, in 2016, experts uncovered 13 footprints which they believe date back more than 3.6 million years. The enigmatic footprints were discovered in modern-day Tanzania and were preserved for millions of years thanks to a region which was at that time covered with wet volcanic ash.</p>
 <p>Then, one evening back in 2013 near Des Plaines, Illinois a woman and her son saw what appeared to be a gargoyle. Then, a woman has a run in with everyone's favorite cryptic "Sasquatch" while out fishing with her family. After the break the sightings just keep piling up as Kyle tells some strange encounters with the little people. Throughout the world, people from all over claim to have run into fairies, elves, trolls and gnomes. What are these strange beings and why do only a small few of us actually see them? All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how as the world population continues to rise and open space becomes more scarce, water might become the next human frontier, in the form of a floating city. Dutch researchers have a model for such livable space, which could include homes, farms and parks. The news agency says the floating city concept could become a reality within a couple of decades for the Netherlands. Then, a law enforcement officer on recently submitted footage of what he calls an unidentified creature. The officer, who chose to remain anonymous,said that he was driving his car south of Lordsburgh, New Mexico,  when his cellphone camera captured the incident this week.</p>
 <p>Then, a woman writes into the show to talk about a scary encounter she had one night while staying over at a friends house. Then, another police officer sees the Mothman in Chicago. After the break Cam brings up some very unusual ghost or spirit sightings from people while they are S.C.U.B.A. diving. All of this and much more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show out talking about how if you step into a taxi in south London later this year and you might not have to think about paying a tip. The UK’s first fully public trial of autonomous vehicles will soon be under way. For four weeks, a fleet of driverless shuttles will each ferry up to five passengers and a “safety warden” along a 2-kilometre route in Greenwich. Previous trials there and in the town of Milton Keynes required participants to register in advance. This time the vehicles will pick up anyone wanting a ride. The four-stop route will connect a hotel close to the O2 Arena concert venue with the Millennium Village housing development. En route, the shuttles will also call at a river-bus stop and a cable car terminal. Then, University of Washington researchers have invented a cellphone that requires no batteries—a major leap forward in moving beyond chargers, cords and dying phones. Instead, the phone harvests the few microwatts of power it requires from either ambient radio signals or light.</p>
 <p>Then, a resident of the Weikert, PA area a friend were on a designated hiking trail in the Bald Eagle State Park when they heard something walking to their right in the woods as if following them. It turned out to not be a bear. What it was, was far more frightening. Then, in a tiny, remote Aboriginal community in outback Australia, an American linguist discovered that a new language emerged among the young people in the community and is now spoken by around 350 individuals, all under the age of 35. But how was this new language spawned when they were already perfectly able to communicate with each other without it? After the break Kyle brings up some incredible encounters with multiple UFOs during the Vietnam War. Some even attacked both American and NVA soldiers. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a district chief in Amnat Charoen province on Wednesday clarified his request for police protection for a village haunted by a "ghost". According to Thai folklore, once "phee pob" inhabits a human body, the person becomes ravenous for raw food - including the organs of live animals. Then, Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters recently posted an encounter with what has become known as The Grinning Man. Then, the actor Rob Lowe will soon debut a TV series on A&amp;E called “The Lowe Files” in which he and his two adult sons go in search of the paranormal. And, he claims that in some cases, they actually found it. Lowe told Entertainment Weekly that he had an “incredible encounter” with a creature known as the wood ape, or the Ozark version of Sasquatch or Bigfoot.</p>
 <p>Then, new research into the behavior of these big cats indicates that they don't like encountering humans any more than we like bumping into them on hiking trails. The findings are particularly valuable as human development encroaches on lion habitat and drives up the number of human-puma encounters. After the break Cam brings up some unusual encounters with Bigfoot in the great state of Florida. Often referred to as The Skunk Ape. Florida's type of Sasquatch seems very smelly as well as elusive. All of this and more on this weeks installment of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

Then, Archaeologists excavating a site in Eastern Ethiopia have found evidence of a mythical “city of giants” which was a thriving center of commerce between the 10th and 15th centuries.</p>
 <p>Then, on June 7, the couple found a canoe on the river bank in Belcher believed to have been carved from a tree by members of the Caddo tribe more than 900 years ago.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about a large upright walking Coyote and Hyena both seen in different parts of the world and at different times. Then, Dating back 11,000 years - with a coded message left by ancient man from the Mesolithic Age - the Shigir Idol is almost three times as old as the Egyptian pyramids. New scientific findings suggest that images and hieroglyphics on the wooden statue were carved with the jaw of a beaver, its teeth intact. Then, A Georgia witness at TyTy reported watching a group of military jets that appeared to be escorting a red-orange sphere at about 600 feet in altitude. After the break the guys chat with friend and author Nick Redfern about his new book "The Roswell UFO Conspiracy". n early July 1947, something crashed outside of Roswell, New Mexico. It was not an alien spaceship, as so many believe. Rather, it was one of a handful of definitively military vehicles that were secretl test-flown in various parts of the Land of Enchantment. All of the flights ended in disaster, and particularly so for the people who were on-board the craft. Coverstories concerning wrecked flying saucers and dead aliens were carefully created. The stories were then spread by those tasked with hiding the dark truth. The far more disturbing picture of what really happened near Roswell was cloaked for years. In fact, for decades. Until now…All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how an ancient, rectangular copper mask recently found in the southern Andes in Argentina is about 3,000 years old — one of the oldest human-made metal object from South America — and its discovery challenges the accepted idea that South American metalworking originated in Peru, according to archaeologists. Then, hitting the snooze button at weekends to make up for early starts during the week may be doing more harm than good. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19025453-500-groggy-mornings-fuel-desire-to-smoke/"> Social jetlag</a> – which occurs when your work and social commitments conflict with your innate desire to sleep at certain times – may increase your risk of heart disease.</p>
 <p>Then, recently a cattleman found one of his cows dead and showing signs of a mysterious mutilation. The animal displayed unusual incisions and some parts of the body were missing. The event caused amazement among the residents of Colonia Los Sauces, Department of Concordia. The cows displayed perfect, cauterized incisions on their heads and bodies, with their tongue and salivary glands extracted along with udders, rectum, part of the large intestine and reproductive tract. Then, a very strange couple was recently spotted in Las Vegas. The witness believes that they were in fact human looking Aliens. </p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up some very disturbing accounts of missing hunters. These hunters were well versed in the outdoors and experienced in the art of bushcraft and survival. It seems unexplainable that they would disappear under mysterious circumstances. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives!</em></p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Elon Musk says that Universal Basic Income — or an economic idea where everyone gets a paycheck from the government to spend how they wish — is one of the only solutions to the rise of robotic automation. Then, Stratolaunch -- which is designed to release rockets that will carry satellites into space -- has a 385-foot wingspan, features six engines used by the Boeing 747, stands 50 feet tall and can carry more than 500,000 pounds of payload. Then, a man from Oregon claims his grandmother’s house was damaged by a “Bigfoot”. Then, a man describes what could only be the flying humanoid from the movie "Jeepers Creepers" in the Bronx back in 2011. </p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up Britain's Roswell simply known as "The Berwyn Mountain Incident". On January 23, 1974, people reported hearing a huge bang, felt earth tremors and saw a brilliant light in the sky above the Berwyn Mountains. Families in the villages of Llandderfel and Llandrillo were settling down to watch TV when an explosion was heard and the ground shook. It measured 3.5 on the Richter scale. As people ran from their homes fearing another tremor, they saw a blaze of light on the mountainside. A nurse who believed an aircraft had crashed drove to the site and saw a pulsating orange and red glow on the hillside and other lights. Police converged on the area and emergency services were put on standby. Although searches were undertaken, officially nothing was found – leading to claims of a cover-up. In the four decades since there has been a huge debate as to what exactly happened that night, with TV documentaries made and books written on the subject. Some researchers have claimed a UFO crashed, with further claims “bodies” were retrieved and taken away by soldiers. Other theories suggest it was a meteor shower combined with an earthquake – the epicentre of which was at Bala Lake – and the misperception of poachers on the hillside carrying lamps.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how bee populations around the world have been in decline for years due to a number of reasons that make it extremely difficult to fix the problem. Urban development, insecticides, fungicides, illness, climate change, and many other factors have been determined to be responsible for the decline in bee populations. This week, the nonprofit Bee Informed Partnership and the Apiary Inspectors of America published their annual survey of 4,963 beekeepers in the United States and it seems that we still have a problem. But it was a slightly better year for our vital pollinating friends. Then, millions of Americans say they engage in extreme binge drinking — or downing at least eight to 10 drinks containing alcohol on a single occasion — and the behavior appears to be on the rise in the U.S., according to a new report. The findings are concerning because this high level of drinking is linked with health and safety risks, including an increased risk of injury or even death, according to the researchers, from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The study "reveals that a large number of people in the United States drink at very high levels and underscores the dangers associated with such 'extreme' binge drinking," George F. Koob, director of the NIAAA, said in a statement. The researchers analyzed information from more than 36,000 Americans ages 18 and older who completed a survey about their alcohol consumption in 2012 to 2013. The researchers asked the participants to report the maximum number of alcoholic drinks they consumed on a single day in the past year. Binge drinking was defined as consuming four or more drinks on a single occasion (for women), or five or more drinks on a single occasion (for men), while extreme binge drinking was defined as consuming double those amounts, or more.</p>
 <p>Then, for years, scientists have debated whether heavy inland snowfall on the vast East Antarctic Ice Sheet — Earth’s largest — balances out the rapid melting in West Antarctica. Given enough snowfall, the continent might not yet be contributing to sea level rise. Most research shows the melt rate is so high that the continent is indeed losing ice. But in 2015, a group of NASA scientists published a controversial study that found Antarctica was instead gaining ice. The NASA team combined space- and land-based measurements and found so much snow dropping in East Antarctica that even with drastic melting elsewhere, the continent was adding some 80 billion tons of ice annually. It contradicted prominent previous findings — including reports from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The result drew global headlines and excited climate change skeptics. That’s despite warnings from the study’s lead author, NASA Goddard’s chief cryospheric scientist Jay Zwally, who predicted that melting would outpace increased snowfall in a decade or two. Then, An Arizona witness traveling by train through Apache County reported watching and photographing six hovering, “two-story” objects beaming light to the ground level.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the incredible tale of "The Black Flash". Shadowy figures have long haunted the pages of history. From ghosts to goblins to things less mentionable, the human psyche has a habit of inventing monsters to inhabit the dark reaches of the unknown. Several such figures have been chronicled: the Halifax Slasher, the London Monster, and Spring-Heeled Jack, to name a few. Today, we’ll be adding another cloaked and hooded terror to the rogue’s gallery, this one known by a name straight out of a comic book: the Black Flash. All of this and more on this weeks episode of <em>Expanded Perspectives</em>!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a couple and some friends traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey for some fun but only had a strange encounter with a Black Eyed Kid. Then, it’s no surprise that the Tyrannosaurus rex had a mighty bite, but just how powerful were its gigantic chompers? A study published Wednesday suggests that the terrifying carnivore crushed its prey with a jaw-dropping 7,800 pounds of force — more than double what any living species can deliver. Then, a Wisconsin witness at Sawyer County reported watching “three stacked orbs” hovering at a nearby tree line for 45 minutes. Then, unusual precipitation doesn’t just belong in myth and legend, and it’s more common than you might think.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up one of the most famous UFO sightings of all time simply known as "The Rendlesham Forest Incident". Dubbed “Britain’s Roswell”, the Rendlesham Forest incident, which took place over a series of nights in December 1980, continues to fascinate UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. As the years have passed, the facts have become increasingly hazy, as statements change and new witnesses come forward. But what we do know for sure is that, in the early hours of December 26 1980, US military personnel (sections of the US Air Force were temporarily stationed at RAF bases in Woodbridge and Bentwaters) spotted strange lights above Rendlesham Forest. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives, the guys start the show off talking about how it might be wise to look away now if you are eating or have a weak stomach, but scientists have discovered that ingesting bogers is good for teeth, and overall health. Scientists at a number of universities including Harvard and the University of Saskatchewan and say parents should not discourage their children from picking their noses because they contain 'a rich reservoir of good bacteria.' Eating snot can also prevent bacteria from sticking to teeth, according to the article published in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The findings even suggest snot could defend against respiratory infections, stomach ulcers and even HIV. Then, A Canadian witness at Edson reported a glowing object following her vehicle just 20 feet overhead. </p>
 <p>Then, this summer, darkness will fall across the face of America. The birds will stop singing, the temperatures will drop and the stars will become visible in the daytime sky. In about 100 days, a total solar eclipse will sweep across the continental United States for the first time since 1918. Astronomers are calling it the Great American Eclipse. For the amateur sky-watcher, a total eclipse presents a rare opportunity to witness a cosmic hiccup in our day-night cycle. For solar astronomers, however, the eclipse offers something else: three minutes (give or take) to collect as much data as possible about the sun’s usually hidden outer atmosphere. Then, the host of the Italian paranormal Youtube channel, <em>The Theory of Truth</em>, spoke of his strange creature encounter in the summer of 2011.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam and Kyle speak with Lon Strickler about many of the recent Mothman sightings near the city of Chicago. Lon began the 'Phantoms and Monsters' blog in 2005, which has steadily grown in popularity and read daily by tens of thousands of paranormal enthusiasts, investigators and those seeking the truth! His research and reports have been featured on hundreds of online media sources. Several of these published reports have been presented on various television segments, including The History Channel's 'Ancient Aliens', Syfy's 'Paranormal Witness' and 'Faked or Faked: Paranormal Files', &amp; Destination America's 'Monsters and Mysteries in America.' As well, he has been interviewed on several radio broadcasts, including multiple guest appearances on 'Coast to Coast AM' and 'Darkness Radio.' He was also featured on Destination America's 'Monsters and Mysteries in America' television show for 'The Sykesville Monster' episode. 'Phantoms &amp; Monsters Fortean Research', in conjunction with the 'UFO Research Center of Pennsylvania,' 'Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society,' 'Crypto Four Corners International' and 'Astral Perceptions Universal', investigates all facets of the paranormal and the supernatural...be it terrestrial or non-terrestrial phenomena.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off by talking about the recent death of the worlds oldest person at 146 years old. Then, an Ohio witness at Sagamore Hills Township reported driving toward an unknown light and discovered a hovering sphere just above the tree line Then, Brent Swancer over at Mysterious Universe posted an article recently describing some possible encounters with the deadly Djinn during the Iraq war. Then, a person in Illinois had a very strange episode of missing time while driving on evening. As they were driving they saw some strange lights ahead, the next thing they remembered was a loss of two hours and being 70 miles away from where they were previously.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam and Kyle talk with movie producer and head of Small Town Monsters, Seth Breedlove. He talks about his new movie "The Mothman of Point Pleasant". Small Town Monsters is an independent film series that explores lost and bizarre history around the United States. Focusing on small town folklore, our team tells stories through the words and experiences of those who were most affected by them - residents and witnesses. Released in Spring of 2015, "Minerva Monster" was the first film in the series, and explored strange occurrences in 1970's Minerva, OH. Our sophmore film, Beast of Whitehall, was released in Spring of 2016; and a third film is scheduled to begin production in late April of 2016. In addition to producing films, Small Town Monsters also attends events throughout the year to screen their movies and talk about these strange tales. DVDs, merchandise and other media related to the series is available in the online store, events, and Vimeo.</p>
 <p>Seth Breedlove is a filmmaker. He has written, edited, produced and directed shorts and features about a variety of topics but is best known for his production company and the films they've produced under the Small Town Monsters banner. Before film, Seth wrote for a number of websites, newspapers and magazines and learned some of the skills he employs as a director while working as a reporter. Seth has also appeared on numerous television and radio programs. In 2013 Seth began working on the concept for a series titled Small Town Monsters. The first chapter in this series is the film, Minerva Monster. Seth wrote and directed the film. He has since begun working on more projects which will fall under the Small Town Monsters umbrella including, Beast of Whitehall, which he also acted as cinematographer on. In 2016 Seth directed and edited his first full-length feature, Boggy Creek Monster. The film is now available on DVD and through streaming services such as Vimeo OnDemand and Amazon Video.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how when Uber first announced <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434580/uber-flying-car-elevate-self-driving-vtol"> its crazy-sounding plan to explore “on-demand urban aviation”</a>— essentially a network of flying taxis that could be hailed via a smartphone app and flown from rooftop to rooftop — the company made it clear that it never intended to go it alone. Recently it kicked off a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15384794/uber-flying-car-vtol-elevate-event-dallas">three-day Elevate conference in Dallas, Texas</a>, the ride-hail company announced a slew of partnerships with cities, aviation manufacturers, real estate, and electric charging companies, in its effort to bring its dream of flying cars a little closer to reality. Then, a Pennsylvania witness at Lancaster County reported watching a nearly 100-foot-long, triangle-shaped object hovering at the tree top level. The witness was driving along back roads between 8 and 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, February 22, 2017, when the incident began.</p>
 <p>Then, a woman in claims she witnessed a “Bigfoot” in Gaston County, North Carolina. 47-year-old woman Tracy Hibberts told Cryptozoology News she was at a restaurant near a wooded area when she spotted the hominid. Then, this strange story comes from the Nigerian website <a href="https://gossip.naij.com/1100851-strange-creature-human-animal-captured-by-a-farmer-ghana-photos.html"> naij.com</a> and is allegedly confirmed by Sikah Bersah, a member of the National Service personnel in the Volta region of Ghana. He said that residents of the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta region had reported that their pigs, cows, chickens and other livestock were being mysteriously killed by something that eats the intestines and internal organs and leaves the rest of the carcass. Sounds like a wild dog or a scavenging animal … except witnesses claimed it was a human that changed into a pig and chased them before disappearing. After the break Kyle brings up some disturbing cases of demonic possession, including a murder who tried to get off claiming the devil made him do it. Therefore, he is not liable. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how it looks like something out of “<a title="" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=star+wars+droids&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP4-HomqzTAhUorlQKHR4DDa8Q_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=1223&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=zcUZLLQEN6xWQM:">Star Wars</a>” or “<a title="" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=star+wars+droids&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP4-HomqzTAhUorlQKHR4DDa8Q_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=1223&amp;dpr=1#tbm=isch&amp;q=terminator&amp;imgrc=pCSg-v5CeO-DcM:">Terminator</a>”: an actual robot capable of walking and shooting guns with both hands. It’s called <a title="" href="http://www.disclose.tv/news/fedor_robot_revealed_rise_of_the_russian_terminator/138576">FEDOR</a> (stands for Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research) and it can now fire guns with both hands. Terrifying, right? Well, <a title="" href="https://twitter.com/DRogozin">Dmitry Rogozin</a>, Russia’s deputy prime minister and the deputy head of the country’s military-industrial commission, insisted on Twitter that the project is about artificial intelligence and not creating a Terminator. Then, as it turns out, some of the best cooks in the world think lion fish, a venomous predatory fish which is breeding out of control and destroying marine ecosystems in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, is delicious. The chefs gathered in Bermuda on Wednesday for a competition dubbed the "Lionfish Throwdown" where they challenged one another to come up with the tastiest solution to the problem of invasive lion fish. A man named Colin Angle, who recently founded Robots In Service of the Environment (RSE), a nonprofit organization set up to protect the oceans, built a machine named the Guardian specifically designed to hunt and capture lionfish.</p>
 <p>Then, Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters recently posted a very strange and unusual sighting! Then, The Loch Ness Monster has been 'declared missing' by its official recorder admitting he is 'worried' that there has been no sightings of her for eight months. After the break Kyle and Cam report on some listener stories originally submitted for the show titled Unusual Encounters. All this an more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how traditional 9am lectures should be scrapped and students should be allowed to start their day later, experts have claimed, following new research that suggests early mornings interfere with young adults’ body clocks. According to researchers at The Open University, lectures should start no earlier than 11am for students to be able to perform at their best. Working with researchers at the University of Nevada, experts analysed the study patterns of 200 students and found academic performance was at its best between 11am and 9.30pm. Then, a woman called into Coast to Coast recently a told a fantastic story her father told her about a strange possible Men In Black experience he had one time back in 1954 while out camping.</p>
 <p>Then, Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters posted an interesting story collected by Albert Rosales about a Black Eyed Being that followed them home. Then, an 8-year-old Ohio boy wanted a cheeseburger and he wanted it bad. So, he got behind the wheel of his dad’s van and took matters into his own hands. One problem was he didn’t know how to drive, but it didn’t take him long to figure it out. The boy said it was simple: He just watched some YouTube videos on how to drive a car. Before long, they said he chauffeured his kid sister effortlessly to the McDonald’s half a mile from his East Palestine home while his parents were sleeping.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up one of the most bizarre missing people cases in American history. The case simply known as the Sodder Family  Murders. On Christmas Eve, 1945, the Sodder family home burned down. The cause was traced to defective wiring despite the fact that Christmas tree lights were still on after the fire started. The oldest two sons and daughter and the youngest daughter survived, but the five middle children were missing and no trace of their remains were found. Believing that the fire was a cover for the abduction of their children, George and Jennie Sodder spent a fortune on detectives to investigate.  The case was never solved and to this day no one knows what happened to the missing children. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how an Earth-sized planet orbiting a dim star 39 light years away has a hazy atmosphere that could indicate the presence of a “water world”. It is one of the first times astronomers have been able to detect an atmosphere surrounding a small rocky planet. Then, a man in Texas released footage on Sunday containing an unidentified flying object. The anonymous man says he was driving to his local grocery store in San Antonio last Wednesday at about 8:30 p.m. when he noticed the anomaly.</p>
 <p>Then, a futuristic video has emerged of a man flying on a hoverboard across the Atlantic Ocean. The video shows Franky Zapata, chief executive of Zapata Racing, whizzing over the sea off the coast of France on a hoverboard that is available for the public to hire. Mr Zapata is riding the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/04/18/watch-this-real-flying-hoverboard-travel-34-mph/"> record-breaking Flyboard Air</a>, which has previously hit the headlines for travelling at more than 34mph. He managed to travel 50 metres above the surface of the Atlantic for just under seven minutes in the most recent flight. Then, scientists are crooning over new pictures that confirm the survival of the New Guinea highland wild dog, which until now was feared to be extinct in its natural habitat on the South Pacific island. Thought to be among the rarest species of canine, the highland wild dogs are either the same as or close relatives of the famous <a href="http://newguinea-singing-dog-conservation.org/Tidbits/AusMamPap.pdf"> singing dogs of New Guinea</a>, which exist only in captivity. More than a hundred camera-trap pictures taken in 2016 show at least 15 wild individuals, including males, females, and pups. Though they are most commonly a golden color, some of the dogs are cream, ginger, roan, or black, with different markings and patternings.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some very strange sightings along empty highways of what could only be described as Phantom Hitchhikers. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a mysterious half-naked 'tribesman' was seen running down a dirt track in Indonesia by a group of bikers. The small man was spotted near Banda Aceh, on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra. Some viewers guessed the man could be a member of the mythical Mante tribe, who are said to be forest dwellers. Then, Lon Stricker over at Phantoms &amp; Monsters recently reported on a very unusual sighting a woman had in Cabell County in West Virginia. According to the witness, this winged creature resembled a giant 4 foot tall Wasp with glowing orange eyes! Then, one of Japan’s biggest tech companies, Rakuten, announced it was forming a joint venture with the American startup AirMap. The goal is to develop a robust traffic management system for unmanned aerial vehicles, allowing large numbers of drones to operate autonomously in the same airspace.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up one of Australia's most famous Alien Abduction cases "The Mysterious Disappearance of Frederick Valentich". On the evening of October 21, 1978, a 20-year-old Australian pilot flew a familiar route from Melbourne airport to King Island. From all reports, it wasn’t a difficult one. But for the young Frederick Valentich, whatever happened while flying over the Bass Strait proved fatal. He never came home, and his body was never recovered. Was it an Alien Abduction or simply pilot error? This and much, much more on this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a non-invasive, tail mounted sensor gathers over 600 pieces of data a second. It can accurately predict when your cow is most likely to give birth by measuring tail movement patterns triggered by labor contractions. When they reach a certain level of intensity over a period of time it then sends an SMS text alert directly to your cell phone on average 1 hour prior to calving. Then, a caller calls in to Coast to Coast and tells a bizarre ghost sighting he and a friend had in South Bend, Indiana.</p>
 <p>Then, apparently a Benewah County woman swears Bigfoot caused her to crash on US Highway 95 in North Latah County late Wednesday night.  The Latah County Sheriff’s Office reports that a 50 year old Tensed woman walked into their office early Thursday morning around 12:30 to report the incident.  She told a deputy she was driving on US95 North of the Potlatch “Y “near mile post 367 earlier that evening around 11:00 Wednesday night when the incident occurred.  The woman believes she saw a Sasquatch chasing some deer along the highway and when she looked into her mirror to see the “hairy beast” she hit a deer which was running from the Bigfoot. Then, a woman on the Dr. Phil show claims that she died 15 years ago and when she woke up, she had psychic abilities. She claims God sent her back with a mission and some gifts. She has stated that I can speak French, I can write the Bengali alphabet, I can understand any foreign language.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam tells the incredible story simply known as <em>"The Bell Witch".</em> The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a poltergeist legend from Southern folklore, centered on the 19th-century Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. John Bell Sr., who made his living as a farmer, resided with his family along the Red River in northwest Robertson County in an area currently within the town of Adams. According to legend, from 1817-1821, his family and the local area came under attack by an invisible entity subsequently described as a witch. The entity was able to speak, affect the physical environment and change forms. Some accounts record the spirit with the capability to be in more than one place at a time, cross distances with rapid speed and the power of prophecy.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how scientists say it's possible to build a new type of self-replicating computer that replaces silicon chips with processors made from DNA molecules, and it would be faster than any other form of computer ever proposed - even <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-built-the-first-reprogrammable-quantum-computer">quantum computers</a>. Called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-deterministic_Turing_machine">nondeterministic universal Turing machine</a> (NUTM), it's predicted that the technology could execute all possible algorithms at once by taking advantage of DNA's ability to replicate almost perfect copies of itself over billions of years. Then, apparently some corpses actually heat up after death. Could this explain some of the Spontaneous Human Combustion stories? Then, a Canadian witness at Port Greville reported discovering a disc-shaped object moving out of a local bay and shooting into the sky after watching video previously shot in the area. Then, a Voodoo Doll causes all kinds of trouble for a small town in rural Nicaragua. After the break Kyle brings up the terrifying story of some lost Cosmonaut's in outer space. All this and more on this weeks addition of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how recently a man named Chris Bertish has become the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a paddle board. This was no ordinary paddleboard. Bertish, a big-wave surfer and sailing enthusiast, worked with naval architect Phil Morrison to create a custom-built 20-foot vessel with a tiny cabin and an even tinier sleeping berth. That’s where he stashed GPS equipment, a satellite weather system, radios, a satellite phone, and an autopilot system. On top of the craft they installed solar panels to keep all those gadgets charged, and Bertish also kept an emergency kit—complete with a life raft and flares—nearby just in case. He also had shark repellant handy, because, well, sharks are scary. The whole getup cost over $120,000 to build. Miraculously, the 42-year-old South African paddled his way from Morocco to Antigua, alone, in just 94 days. That’s 4,500 nautical miles of unassisted and unsupported ocean-faring. Then, A University of Nebraska senior, Brevan Jorgenson, shelled out a mere $700 for open source software that he used to turn his vehicle into a self-driving car. Jorgenson was an early beta-tester for the <a href="http://ucomma.ai">ucomma.ai</a>, an ultimately unsuccessful company that had hoped to make autonomous driving affordable and easy to apply to any car. While fortune did not side with <a href="http://ucomma.ai">ucomma.ai</a>, it seems to have smiled upon Jorgenson, who was able to utilize what he knew to let his car drive itself on the freeway.</p>
 <p>Then, a  popular diving site filled with spectacular coral reefs has been severely damaged in West Papua, New Guinea, after a British-owned cruise ship got caught in low tide and slammed into it. Because of this, It could take years for the reefs to bounce back, and tha may never regain what they originally looked like. Local officials want the company to pay for the damage. The coral reefs are located at Raja Ampat, an Indonesian island chain. On March 4, a 295-foot-long, 4,290-ton ship called the <a href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/reviews/cruiseline.cfm?CruiseLineID=143">Caledonian Sky</a> ran aground along a stretch of beach, damaging the pristine reefs below. Then, Virginia has made robotics history. The commonwealth is the first state to pass legislation allowing delivery robots to operate on sidewalks and crosswalks across the state. The new law goes into effect on July 1 and was signed into law by the governor last Friday. The two Virginia lawmakers who sponsored the bill, Ron Villanueva and Bill DeSteph, teamed up with Starship Technologies, an Estonian-based ground delivery robotics company, to draft the legislation. Robots operating under the new law won’t be able to exceed 10 miles per hour or weigh over 50 pounds, but they will be allowed to rove autonomously. The law doesn’t require robots to stay within line of sight of a person in control, but a person is required to at least remotely monitor the robot and take over if it goes awry. Robots are only allowed on streets in a crosswalk.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how US private rocket company SpaceX has announced that two private citizens have paid to be sent around the Moon. The mission is planned for late 2018, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said, adding that the tourists "have already paid a significant deposit". "This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years," he said. The two unnamed people will fly aboard a spaceship which is set for its first unmanned test flight later this year. Mr Musk said the co-operation of America's Nasa space agency had made the plan possible. He said the two passengers "will travel faster and further into the solar system than any before them". Mr Musk declined to reveal their identities, only saying that they knew each other and that "it's nobody from Hollywood". Then, Military bigwigs gathered in Orlando this week for the annual AirWarfare Symposium to discuss big plans for big weapons that do big damage. According to a report, the biggest unfunded project that U.S. Special Operations Command hopes to push through is a C-130 that’s equipped with a power laser weapon.</p>
 <p>Then, a Cumberand County, PA, witness reported an unusual series of “huge, bright, round lights” beaming to the ground level near her property with no sound that appeared to get her dog’s attention, according to testimony in Cases 82026 and 82029 from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) witness reporting <a href="http://database.Case">database.Case</a> was reported February 12, 2017, for an incident that occurred about 1:30 a.m. on November 15, 2016. Then, a young mother living in York, UK, says that her flat is haunted by an evil spirit. In fact it has been scratched her before. Now she want's to leave but the landlord will not let her out of her lease.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up the story of Atlanta's very on Jack the Ripper case of 1911. For four years in Atlanta, beginning in 1911, someone terrorized the African American community and became known as the Atlanta Ripper, a play off the name of the famous London killer in the Whitechapel district in the late 1800s known as "Jack the Ripper." For those four years, an unknown killer, or as some put it, killers, roamed the dark streets of Atlanta, preying upon young African American women, as well as some of mixed race. The list of victims swelled to over 20 people, as the city was in the grips of fear over where and against whom the fiend would strike next.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Brazil's elusive tree boa, <em>Corallus cropanii — </em>also known as Cropan's boa — is one of the world's rarest boas, infrequently sighted and known from only a handful of dead specimens collected after the snake was first seen and described in 1953. However, the species is alive and well, scientists recently discovered. One of the slippery serpents was captured in January — the second living specimen ever seen, and the first glimpsed in 64 years. Then, humans have had music on the brain for most of our existence—cultures all over the world create, listen to, and experience pleasure from music. To study this phenomenon, researchers have surveyed people’s feelings, scanned the brains of performers and listeners, and even measured hormone production. Their findings thus far suggest that our enjoyment comes from the same two-phase reward process—a dopamine-driven anticipatory phase, followed by a dopamine- and opioid-influenced consummatory phase—that kicks into gear when you eat a tasty treat or experience a rush after an intense workout.</p>
 <p>Then, according to a number of reports, a photograph reputedly of a reptilian alien taken outside of Luke Air Force Base was posted to 4chan on Thursday. Within minutes, the entire website was allegedly taken offline and all copies of the photograph mysteriously disappeared, except for one. 4chan is the highly controversial image board site associated with a wide variety of equally controversial and nefarious groups and famous for its pranks. According to various accounts, an anonymous thread titled “24489 Taken Aprox 24 miles north west of Luke Airforce Base Phoenix Az. Lab H4C” was begun between on 4chan’s /pol/ board between 12am and 2am on February 23rd. It included a picture of an alien which was said to have yellow scales, black eyes and small pursed lips and was looking directly at the camera in a classic selfie pose. Reports say the thread was only up for a few minutes before the 4chan channel went offline. When it returned, all traces of the photo and thread were gone. Then, a Pennsylvania construction worker says he photographed an unknown creature he believes “had the exact marks” of the Jersey Devil. 32-year-old R.W. claimed that on Friday he was driving on the highway about an hour outside of Philadelphia when he and his friend spotted the creature.</p>
 <p>After the break the guys chat with researcher, author and rocker Lyle Blackburn about his latest book "<em>Beyond Boggy Creek</em>". Lyle Blackburn is an author, musician, and cryptid researcher from Texas. His investigative cryptozoology books, such as <em>The Beast of Boggy Creek</em> and <em>Lizard Man</em>, reflect his life-long fascination with legends and sighting reports of real-life 'monsters.' During his research, Lyle has often explored the remote reaches of the southern U.S. in search of shadowy creatures said to inhabit the dense backwoods and swamplands of these areas.</p>
 <p>Lyle is also a staff writer for the monthly horror magazine, <em>Rue Morgue</em>, and founder of the rock band <a href="http://www.ghoultown.com/">Ghoultown</a>.</p>
 <p>Lyle has been heard on numerous radio programs including <em>Coast To Coast AM</em>, has appeared on various television shows airing on Discovery, Animal Planet, Destination America, A&amp;E, HGTV, and CBS, and served as consulting producer and special episode host for the tv show <em>Monsters and Mysteries in America</em>. Most recently, Lyle was featured in the documentary film, <em>Boggy Creek Monster</em>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how what happens when your own devices turn against you? In one bizarre case a man's electronic Pace Maker actually provided evidence against him in an arson case. And a woman's FitBit actually led Police to realize that she was lying about an attempted rape. It turns out that privacy issues are moving under our skin—now the devices that keep us alive and healthy can also be used against us in the court of law. Then, a possible Gorilla like Sasquatch sighting in Texas back in 1960. The story comes from the <em>Sherman Democrat</em> that was originally printed in the July 20, 1960 edition. It is one more piece evidence that proves sightings of wood ape-like creatures predate the famous Patterson-Gimlin footage.</p>
 <p>Then, there are some who firmly believe the human race knows more about distant galaxies and alien planets located light years away from Earth than what lies beneath the surface of our planet. Curiously, it took the Voyager 1 spacecraft nearly 26 years to exit our solar system, which is about the same amount of time scientists on Earth needed to penetrate 12 kilometers into our planet’s surface. After more than two decades, scientists created the Kola Superdeep Borehole and a drill depth of more than 7.5 miles (12 kilometers). The Kola Superdeep Borehole reached 12,262 meters (40,230 ft) in 1989 becoming the deepest artificial point on our planet. </p>
 <p>Then, a strange story from New York City back in 1989. The witness was lying in bed unable to sleep when a very bright white light entered the room. Then three or four humanoids entered her bedroom apparently through the walls and stood by her bed. These beings were described as 5-foot tall, wide, and heavyset, with large heads, large pupil less eyes, no ears, or hair with dark bluish skin. Their hands were very large with thick fingers and nails. They wore white coats down to their ankles. She was asked to come with them and followed them down to the street. After the break Cam brings up some strange and unusual encounters with the Men In Black and some possible Women In Black.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how researchers have discovered a 5,000-year-old beer recipe by studying the residue on the inner walls of pottery vessels found in an excavated site in northeast China. It’s the earliest evidence of beer production in China so far. Then, the researchers at DeepMind have been working with two games to test whether neural networks are more likely to understand motivations to compete or cooperate. They hope that this research could lead to AI being better at working with other AI in situations that contain imperfect information.</p>
 <p>Then, a man in Maryland claims he and two other people saw an unknown big bird he believes to be Thunderbird. The 55-year-old press operator, who asked to be kept anonymous, told Cryptozoology News that he was in the kitchen when his twin brother noticed the oddity. Then, frightening first-hand accounts of the Black Eyed Children have been flooding the internet for the last few years, terrifying readers with tales of strange kids showing up on doorsteps in the middle of the night, causing strange illnesses, and even resulting in the death of anyone foolish enough to let them in their homes. Now a relatively new type of encounter has started to crop up: Black Eyed Adults.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some bizarre phantom phone calls. Can the telephone be used as an instrument to allow the dead to communicate with the living? Whether it’s to say one last goodbye or even to warn of impending danger, phantom phone calls are a real and documented paranormal phenomenon. Here are four such cases of people who were mysteriously contacted from the “beyond”.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how for some people the the snapping of gum. The slurping of soup makes them shudder. They despise it. If that person is you then you likely have Misophonia. For you that  have misophonia, these sounds are more than merely annoying—they’re rage-inducing. Being trapped in a room of snappers and slurpers is enough to make you  walk away or set yourself  on fire. All too often, folks with misophonia—which literally means “hatred of sound—are dismissed as being over dramatic. But new research suggests that they aren’t just making this up—there’s a neurological basis for your anger.</p>
 <p>Then, a Florida witness at Titusville reported watching an oval-shaped object crossing the sky “shrouded in the bright, meteor-like light” while waiting for an Atlas V rocket launch. Then, Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters, recently posted an interesting sighting of some sort of bat winged type creature that sounds eerily similar to another sighting years earlier reported to Stan Gordon. Then, Cam brings up a recent unusual Thunderbird sighting that took place in  Minnesota. 14-year-old Logan says he and his friend were skateboarding next to a lake when they found the winged creature. “We got off our boards and walked over to our walk in boat access,” said Logan. “We walked down by the lake just to skip rocks and stuff and we both saw it,” he added. The afternoon sighting reportedly lasted about five minutes. The boy described the creature as a featherless bird with a crest on its head and a long beak curved towards the back at the end. It had no tail. “It was huge. It flew low across the lake turning quite sharply for its size and then just flew away towards the town square on the other side of the lake, but it gained a lot of height very quickly it disappeared in the clouds.”</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up the historic story of the Baker Hotel. Historically known for the legendary healing properties of the water, The Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells, Texas was opened in 1929, two weeks after the great stock market crash. Rising 14 floors, The Baker Hotel was the first skyscraper built outside of a major metropolitan area. Costing $1.2 million to build, the hotel was developed by Texas entrepreneur T.B. Baker and featured progressive hotel amenities including the first Olympic size hotel swimming pool, air conditioning, circulating ice water for the guest rooms, automatic light controls to turn off lights when guests leave the room and lock their doors, and valet doors for dry cleaning to keep hotel employees from disturbing the guests. Doing well throughout the Great Depression, the Baker hosted many celebrity music performers such as Lawrence Welk, Jack Amlung, Herbie Kaye, Guy Lombardo, Mary Martin and Paul Whiteman and a long list of legendary guests including Lyndon Johnson, Pat Boone, Jack Dempsey, Marlene Dietrich, Dale Evans, Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Will Rogers, Roy Rogers, Elliot Rossevelt, the Three Stooges, and Bonnie and Clyde.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the off by talking about how over the millennia, animals have gone extinct on Earth for many different reasons. Sometimes it's because of a dramatic shift in the climate. Other times it was because of human intervention. Advances in science, specifically biotechnology, could enable scientists to bring some of these animals "back" from extinction, and there are a few already on the list. Then, Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters posted a story about a man who spotted what he can only describe as a White Bigfoot. Then, Lon posted a sighting a Werewolf like creature spotted along a road in rural Pennsylvania. The witness saw it swim across a river and the re-emerge on the other side. It stood up on two legs and ran off. Then, according to Cryptozoology News a man in Canada reportedly spotted three alien beings working on a spacecraft. The anonymous man claims he was walking his dog at Earl Bales Park when he noticed a few lights in the distance.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up some very unusual places. Places that seem to draw people who are suicidal to them. Suicide is recognized as the ultimate expression of despair. And even though the person making the decision to die may find some sense of peace, family and friends are left in a maelstrom of devastation and pain. According to the World Health Organization, there are over one million successful suicides every year – which works out as a death every 40 seconds. Ironically, these desperate acts of self-destruction are often carried out in some of the most beautiful locations in the world.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how a lot of people mix up children's names or friends' names and as it turns out it's because you love them. It's not related to a bad memory or to aging, but rather to how the brain categorizes names. It's like having special folders for family names and friends names stored in the brain. Then, according to a new study recently published in the journal Science Advances, evidence shows that humans occupied much of the Sahara during the ‘wet period’ around 8,000 years ago. Through an analysis of marine sediments, researchers at the University of Arizona have determined rainfall patterns in the Sahara over a period of 6,000 years obtaining fascinating results. The UA-led team has identified the climate pattern that generated a “Green Sahara” from 5,000 to 11,000 years ago. The region had 10 times the rainfall it does today.</p>
 <p>Then, a Tennessee resident was recently startled by a Bigfoot type creature. Around 10:00pm a man heard some rustling around on his back patio. He went out to investigate and that's when he saw a large hairy humanoid. Then, Cam brings up the story of "Viracocha". Viracocha was the supreme god of the Incas. He is also known as Huiracocha, Wiraqoca and Wiro Qocha. Considered the creator god he was the father of all other Inca gods and it was he who formed the earth, heavens, sun, moon and all living beings. When he finished his work he was believed to have travelled far and wide teaching humanity and bringing the civilised arts before he headed west across the Pacific, never to be seen again but promising one day to return. In his absence lesser deities were assigned the duty of looking after the interests of the human race but Viracocha was, nevertheless, always watching from afar the progress of his children.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start out talking about how in tests on mice, alcohol activated the brain signals that tell the body to eat more food. The UK researchers, who report their findings in the journal Nature Communications, believe the same is probably true in humans. It would explain why many people say they eat more when they have had a few drinks. Rather than loss of restraint, it is a neuronal response, the Francis Crick Institute team says.</p>
 <p>Then, recently someone wrote Lon Strickler over at Phantoms and Monsters about a strange Dogman like creature they saw one evening in 2013 in southeast Manitoba. Then, a team of scientists selected by federal officials in Seattle have come across new evidence in the mystery of D.B. Cooper. The Citizen Sleuths have been analyzing particles found on the clip-on-tie that Cooper left behind after he hijacked a Northwest Orient airplane in November 1971. Tom Kaye, the lead researcher of the group, told King 5 on Friday that a powerful microscope used in their investigation has found more than 100,000 particles on the JCPenny tie. He added that the group has been trying to identify where some of the particles, including Cerium, Strontium, Sulfide and titanium, may have come from. Then, David Wheatherly posted a rash of strange Sasquatch like sightings that took place in and near Fontana, California back in 1966.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up a story of tragedy known today as "The Lost Franklin Expedition".  The HMS Terror and Franklin’s flagship, HMS Erebus, were abandoned in heavy sea ice far to the north of the eventual wreck site in 1848, during the Royal Navy explorer’s doomed attempt to complete the Northwest Passage. All 129 men on the Franklin expedition died, in the worst disaster to hit Britain’s Royal Navy in its long history of polar exploration. Search parties continued to look for the ships for 11 years after they disappeared, but found no trace, and the fate of the missing men remained an enigma that tantalized generations of historians, archaeologists and adventurers.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about space junk. How big is the problem and what are we going to do about it. Few humans have ever stepped foot in space but as a species we've already managed to make a mess of Earth's backyard. Space junk from satellites and rockets is crowding out spacecraft and telecommunication satellites in Earth's orbit, and putting humans at risk. It's a big problem, and getting bigger every day. Then, robots can be terrifying all on their own, but stick a human being inside and give them control of the mechanical muscles that provide superhuman strength and you've got a recipe for a horror movie. South Korean robotics firm Hankook Mirae Technology has done exactly that, and its Method-2 robot just took its first steps towards world domination this week. The robot is just one year into development, but it's already a hulking beast that could give anyone nightmares. The bot stands over 13 feet tall and weighs over one and a half tons. Its sturdy metal arms weigh nearly 300 pounds each, and with its human-like hands it's a spitting image of the intimidating militarized robot suits that play a starring role in the sci-fi flick <em>Avatar</em>.</p>
 <p>Then, Greg Newkirk over on the Week In Weird posted a very interesting encounter a man had with the legendary "Hat Man" all the way back in 1969 somewhere in Northern Virginia. Then, a 12-year-old boy on Wednesday said he saw an unidentified biped he believes was a “Bigfoot” creature. The middle school student, who provided his identity but was kept anonymous as per the standard code of journalism ethics regarding disclosure of the identity of a minor, said he his brother were at a friend’s orchad in Beaverton when they allegedly spotted the animal. “It was probably around 6:30 p.m.,” he said. “The sun was going down and when I saw it, he pointed it out too.” The eyewitness claims he wasn’t sure what it was until he realized the familiar outline of a primate. “I think it was a Bigfoot. It was very large, about 7 feet tall. From where I was standing, it looked very tall.”</p>
 <p>After the break Cam and Kyle talk about the incredible Ingo Swann. INGO SWANN (September 14, 1933 - January 31, 2013) was internationally known as an advocate and researcher of the exceptional powers of the human mind, and as a leading figure in governmental and scientific projects to investigate and identify the scope of subtle human perceptions. Since 1970, his name and work have been incorporated into most contemporary books about PSI and the "paranormal." He was featured in four volumes of Time-Life's bestselling series entitled Mysteries of the Unknown. His contributive work has achieved broad media notice and been featured in every major American/British television documentary on the subject of PSI phenomena and Remote Viewing. Swann has been interviewed and/or profiled in dozens of magazines, including Time, Reader's Digest, Smithsonian and Newsweek. Swann's early work in parapsychology, as a noted and highly successful "guinea pig," made him a psychic superstar in that field. His subsequent research on behalf of American intelligence interests, including that of the CIA, won him top PSI-spy status. His involvement in government research projects required the discovery of innovative approaches toward the actual realizing of subtle human energies. He viewed PSI powers as only parts of the larger spectrum of human sensing systems.</p>
 <p>Swann was the author of over ten books. His publisher, Crossroad Press, is reissuing many titles as ebooks, audio books and paperback books, among them, Penetration: The Question of Extraterrestrial and Human Telepathy; Purple Fables; Psychic Sexuality; The Great Apparitions of Mary; The Wisdom Category; and Star Fire, with more to come. Ingo Swann was also a visionary artist and his exquisite works can be found at The American Visionary Art Museum, The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), The Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, and ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries. His extensive data base of writings on what he considered the Superpowers of the Human Biomind are available on this website in the Researcher section, while his collection of research, books and correspondences is housed within Special Collections, Ingram Library at the University of West Georgia.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how when you engage in international travel, you may one day find yourself face-to-face with border security that is polite, bilingual and responsive—and robotic. The Automated Virtual Agent for Truth Assessments in Real Time (AVATAR) is currently being tested in conjunction with the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to help border security agents determine whether travelers coming into Canada may have undisclosed motives for entering the country.  "AVATAR is a kiosk, much like an airport check-in or grocery store self-checkout kiosk," said San Diego State University management information systems professor Aaron Elkins. "However, this kiosk has a face on the screen that asks questions of travelers and can detect changes in physiology and behavior during the interview. The system can detect changes in the eyes, voice, gestures and posture to determine potential risk. It can even tell when you're curling your toes."</p>
 <p>Then, an anonymous caller from Aurora, Illinois called into Coast to Coast back in october of 2000, described his weird encounter while driving to Peoria in June of 2000. According to the witness, he and a buddy saw what they can only describe as "The Grim Reaper". Then, MAGRET, Ala. — A former soldier on Friday said he saw an unidentified flying creature in St. Clair County. Mike, a 48-year-old Magret resident, told Cryptozoology News he and his wife were driving when they noticed the creature coming out of the trees located on the side of the road. Then, according to an eye witness, they saw what they believe were a few Black Eyed Kids surrounding they're car one evening while driving home.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up an incredible story of a small mining town in remote Alaska that were actually driven out by wild hairy men. All of this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how according to reports, scientists in china claim they have successfully created a ‘working prototype of the impossible, reactionless engine, and say that they have already begun testing it orbit aboard their Tiangong-2 space laboratory. The controversial, radical and revolutionary fuel-free EmDrive has created a buzz in the scientific community after a paper published by scientists at NASA showed the technology works successfully. Then, a now-submerged Stone Age settlement has been mapped in the Baltic Sea, revealing how its ancient inhabitants lived along what was once a lagoon on the coast of Sweden some 9,000 years ago. The exceptionally well-preserved site was discovered about seven years ago, after divers came upon what are now considered to be the oldest stationary fish traps in northern Europe. It turns out that those fishing traps were a part of the Haväng site, which archaeologists now believe was once a lagoon environment where Mesolithic humans lived during parts of the year.</p>
 <p>Then, Nick Redfern tells a story of an apparent sighting of a very strange water cryptic off the coast of British Columbia, Canada along with his wife and son back in the mid 1930's. Then, researchers have warned it is already too late to stop killer robots - and say banning them would be little more than a temporary solution. University at Buffalo researchers claim 'society is entering into a situation where systems like these have and will become possible. Elon Musk and Professor Stephen Hawking have both warned that artificial intelligence could develop a will of its own that is in conflict with that of humanity, and could herald dangers like powerful autonomous weapons. After the break Cam brings up some stories of human beings with incredible super human abilities. Did you know that people with real superpowers actually exist? People who possess incredible sight, stamina, and durability. But that’s not all. Some even possess the ability to project energy, have an uncanny memory, and even employ X-ray vision! So if you’ve ever wished you could have superpowers similar to Superman, the Hulk, Wolverine, or any other awesome superhero, guess what, its possible (sort of).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how back in September 1904 a group of people witnessed something truly bizarre near Preston, Texas. When discovered by a party of hunters on his all fours pawing and neighing like a horse, their attention was first attracted by what they took to be the whining of a startled horse in the undergrowth. When advanced upon, the strange being ran off on his hands and feet but the pursuers gained upon him so rapidly he sprang to his feet and quickly covering the short distance to the river, plunged headlong from a rather high bank into the water and swam to the Indian side. When he reached that bank he stood up, shook himself like a horse just out of a bath, and with what might really be called a horse laugh ran off into the woods.</p>
 <p>Then, another odd sighting, this too back in the early twentieth century. From the December 19th, 1913 edition of the<em> Santa Fe New Mexican</em> newspaper,  A Werewolf in the Bronx. According to the article, several people including a few police officers saw a very strange phosphorous covered glowing hound near the Mosholu Parkway. One night it even attacked a police officer! Then, a New Mexico witness at Roswell reported a late-night encounter with a silent, triangle-shaped UFO just 20 feet ahead while driving along a main road moving out of town. The reporting witness stated that she and her husband were driving from Albuquerque to Carlsbad and had stopped in Roswell to grab a bite to eat before continuing their journey on October 24, 2016. “After eating – well after sunset – we headed back on the main road out of town,” the witness stated.“Stopping at a red light, behind a couple cars, in our truck with vehicles all around us, we both noticed and said out loud that the object was coming straight towards us from the dark sky.” The two had recently seen other strange lights. “In the two week’s prior we had seen ‘lights’ in the sky around Albuquerque and thought this was going to be the same – nope.”</p>
 <p>Then, between September 6 and October 3, 2016, the US Navy’s science and technology wing sent four small boats on patrol missions in the lower Chesapeake Bay. The only unusual thing was the fact that the boats were autonomous robots. These robots are not like drones with humans operating them from a remote trailer in Arizona. The vessels, loaded with cameras and sensors, were more like autonomous individuals within a larger robotic collective. The Office of Naval Research, which put on the demonstration, had not done this before. After the break Kyle brings up some rather disturbing true stories of real cannibals just in time for Christmas! Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show talking about they're favorite Holiday drinks and then in Italy, the legend of La Befana is one that is popularly told around the time of the Epiphany. What does a Catholic holiday have to do with modern Paganism? Well, La Befana happens to be a witch. According to folklore, on the night before the feast of the Epiphany in early January, Befana flies around on her broom, delivering gifts. Much like Santa Claus, she leaves candy, fruit, or small gifts in the stockings of children who are well-behaved throughout the year. On the other hand, if a child is naughty, he or she can expect to find a lump of coal left behind by La Befana.</p>
 <p>Then, Researchers at Oregon State have patented a new strain of seaweed that tastes like bacon when it's cooked. The seaweed, a form of red marine algae, looks like translucent red lettuce. It also has twice the nutritional value of kale and grows very quickly. Did we mention it tastes like bacon? According to Oregon State researcher Chris Langdon, his team started growing the new strain while trying to find a good food source for edible sea snails, or abalone, a very popular food in many parts of Asia. The strain is a new type of red algae that normally grows along the Pacific and Atlantic coastlines. Then, Kyle brings up two strange Humanoid sightings where in both cases they were wearing some sort of shinny one piece suits.</p>
 <p>Then, Cam brings up an interesting account of a hunter spotting something in the woods otherworldly. The witness and his cousin were out hunting near Johnson City, TN and were sitting on the side of the wall of a rather large hollow which consisted of very thick underbrush and lots of evergreen. A larger valley then lead first to a clearing and then on to a supposed old Indian graveyard. All of the sudden they heard the brush in the hollow below rattling and they could tell that whatever was making the sounds was rather large. What appeared before them was a three horned man beast.</p>
 <p>After the break Cam brings up some fascinating Gnome sightings from different parts of the world. The Gnome is one of a species of diminutive beings, usually described as shriveled little old men, that inhabit the interior of the earth and act as guardians of its treasures. Gnomes are very widespread species, known to a number of human races. Germans name them Erdmanleins, except in the Alpine areas, where they are called Heinzemannchens. In Denmark and Norway they are Nisse; Nissen is a Swedish variation. In Brittany they are called Nains. Tontti to the Finns and Foddenskkmaend is their name in Iceland. The Polish call they by the familar Gnom. Bulgaria and Albania, however, use Dudje. In Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, Gnomes are called Mano. The Dutch use Kabouter and the Belgian, Skritek. Switzerland and Luxembourg use the same name, Kleinmanneken, which means "littlemen." Domovoi Djedoes is used in western Russia.</p>
 <p>Gnomes consist of a number of different types. The most common is the Forest Gnome who rarely comes into contact with man. The Garden Gnome lives in old gardens and enjoys telling melancoly tales. Dune Gnomes are slightly larger than their woodland breathren and choose remarkably drab clothing. House Gnomes have the most knowledge of man, often speaking his language. It is from this family that Gnome Kings are chosen. Farm Gnomes resemble their House brethen, but are more conservative in manner and dress. Siberian Gnomes have been more interbred than other Gnomes and associate freely with trolls. They are much larger than the other types and have an infinately more nasty nature. It is best never to evoke the ire of such Gnomes for they delight in revenge.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about a person who had a very strange encounter with what appeared to be a 7ft tall monkey who was in control of an Owl with the face of person. Then, Dr. Hirotaka Sato, an aerospace engineer at Nanyang Technological University. Sato and his team are turning live beetles into cyborgs by electrically controlling their motor functions. Having studied the beetles' muscle configuration, neural networks, and leg control, the researchers wired the insects so that they could be controlled by a switchboard. In doing so, the researchers could manipulate the different walking gaits, speeds, flying direction, and other forms of motion. Essentially, the beetles became like robots with no control over their own motor functioning. Interestingly, though the researchers control the beetles through wiring, their energy still comes naturally from the food they eat. Hence, the muscles are driven by the insects themselves, but they have no willpower over how their muscles move.</p>
 <p>Then, a video of a formation of UFOs that the witness claimed was chasing him was just one of the multiple sightings in and around Brandon, Canada, last week, according to various news reports. In fact, so many witnesses came forward that the UFO sightings made the local news. And when it was posted that said UFOs might have been flares from a military exercise, conspiracy theorists started floating the idea of another government cover-up. <em>Local newspapers</em> reported last week that comparisons of the multiple UFO sightings of a formation of glowing objects in the sky above Brandon, Canada, have been made to the 1997 incident now known as “The Phoenix Lights,”</p>
 <p>After the break the guys have on friend of the show Ryan Sprague to discuss his new book "Somewhere In The Skies". Ryan Sprague is a professional playwright and screenwriter in New York City. He is also an investigative journalist specializing in the topic of UFOs. He has written for numerous publications, including Open Minds Magazine, Phenomena Magazine, and UFO Truth Magazine. Speaking on the UFO topic, he has been featured on ABC News, Fox News, The Science Channel, and recently became a regular on the Travel Channel's Mystery at the Museum. He is also the co-host for both the Into The Fray &amp; UFOmodPod podcasts. His First book, Somewhere In The Skies: A Human Approach to an Alien Phenomenon, is now available via Richard Dolan Press.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how recently Egypt has unearthed a city more than 7,000 years old and a cemetery dating back to its first dynasty in the southern province of Sohag, the antiquities ministry has said. The find could be a boon for Egypt’s ailing tourism industry, which has suffered a series of setbacks since the uprising that toppled the autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011, but remains a vital source of foreign currency. The city is likely to have housed high-ranking officials and grave builders. Its discovery may yield new insights into Abydos, one of the oldest cities in ancient Egypt, the ministry said in a statement. Experts say Abydos was Egypt’s capital towards the end of the predynastic period and during the rule of the first four dynasties. The discovery was made 400 metres away from the temple of Seti I, a New Kingdom period memorial across the Nile from present day Luxor.</p>
 <p>Then, space is still the final frontier, and as NASA scientists prepare to try and venture further into the solar system than humans have ever gone before there's a very important issue they want to solve — how to poop, pee and be on your period in space, without having to use a space diaper. That's right, astronauts have always looked cool in their super space gear as they prepared to be blasted into orbit, but all the while, every single astronaut has been stuck wearing a diaper during launches and landings. (When they reach space there are specially designed waste collection systems to use and of course on Earth there are gas station bathrooms galore.) This gets even more gross when you consider that astronauts often have to spend up to 10 hours in their spacesuits as they wait for the launch or prepare for re-entry, so they definitely have to use those diapers at some point. However, now NASA officials are trying to come up with a way to finally ditch the diaper, and they're asking for the public's help with the crowdsourced "space poop challenge" which is exactly what it sounds like — NASA wants you to help them figure out astronauts can do their business in space.</p>
 <p>Then, Japanese businesses are finding they need to deal with increasing numbers of foreign visitors to Japan, and Panasonic thinks it has the answer: a megaphone that translates the user’s voices into multiple languages. The Megahonyaku, which is a reasonably good pun on the Japanese words for “megaphone” and “translation,” listens for Japanese input and plays back phrases in English, Chinese, and Korean. Then, Kyle brings up and unusual sighting a woman named Victoria D had one night while her and some friends drove through Cannock Chase, UK. They saw what appeared to be a large werewolf like creature.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up some lesser known alien abductions. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how six years ago, divers discovered the oldest known stationary fish traps in northern Europe off the coast of southern Sweden. Since then, researchers at Lund University in Sweden have uncovered an exceptionally well-preserved Stone Age site. They now believe the location was a lagoon environment where Mesolithic humans lived during parts of the year. Other spectacular finds include a 9,000-year-old pick axe made out of elk antlers. The discoveries indicate mass fishing and therefore a semi-permanent settlement. </p>
 <p>Then, Medieval archer's 'unique quiver' and arrows with iron tips found in hole in a cliff, along with his wooden sarcophagus. Two local residents accidentally stumbled across the burial site, close to the village of Kokorya, which contains the bones of an adult man, his birch bark quiver, arrow shafts and iron arrow heads, intricate ornaments and utensils made from the roots of trees, as well as the remnants of silk ribbons. He is believed to be a warrior with a talent for archery who lived around the 13th to 15th century like the legendary outlaw Robin Hood in England. The archer is likely to have been held in respect, confirmed by the location of his burial and the care taken to send him into the next life with his arrows and 'sophisticated' quiver. It has pockets for different types of arrows, say scientists. Archeologists have not yet secured permission to open the wooden sarcophagus, although locals who found and looked inside confirm it contains bones, and it may also have the marksman's bow.</p>
 <p>Then, Kyle brings up two bizarre Dogman sightings. One from 1951 near Eureka, California and other from 1972 near Muncie, Indiana. In both stories, the people who witnessed the strange creature were young, 8-10 years old. Both give similar descriptions like it being covered in hair, long dog like snout, body built like a large ape, in both cases it either growled or howled and in one of the sightings it appeared to be wearing clothes.</p>
 <p>Then, in 1945, the FBI raided a warehouse in Los Angeles that was used for storage by the German Consulate. Among the files, they found a collection of 3x5-inch cards kept by the Nazi regime containing contact information for important people in LA. The cards included the names, addresses, and phone numbers of people in the entertainment industry, academia, and industry. And it serves as a terrifying reminder that the normalization of the Nazis in the 1930s provided cover for some very powerful people in the US to be friendly with genocidal maniacs.</p>
 <p>After the break, Cam brings up some unusual sightings of strange orbs. Are they ghosts, spirits or something other worldly? Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how if you want a decent night’s sleep stop fiddling with your phone, researchers have warned. A US study has found that greater screen time, particularly at bedtime, is linked to disrupted sleep patterns - including taking a longer time to drop off. “The more screen time, the worse the quality of sleep,” said Gregory Marcus, co-author of the research from the University of California, San Francisco. The research ties in with a growing body of evidence that suggests that using electronic devices can get in the way of shut-eye.</p>
 <p>Then, on a quiet day in March, 1966, seven eyewitnesses reported an unidentified flying object maneuvering over Livingston and Washtenaw counties in Michigan. But these were not just some crazy people who watched all this there were police officers, sherrif deputies and over a 100 other people. an official investigation declared it was an optical illusion created by swamp gas. But some say that's just what the government wanted us to believe. The even became known as the Great UFO Flap of 1966. Then, a man said he and his family members saw a dinosaur-like animal at a fishing spot in Florida. Then, Lon Strickler of Phantoms and Monsters recently posted an interesting interview a man did with a witness who describes what he saw at the famous Roswell Crash.</p>
 <p>After the break Kyle brings up the unusual story of the Jersey Devil. Ask people who live near the Pine Barrens of New Jersey if they actually believe in the Jersey Devil and you'll get a bunch of half-answers Those who say they do say it with a little smirk, those who don't believe in the creature still hesitate a little before giving a definitive "no." The Jersey Devil is a mythical horned beast that is to the woods of the Atlantic City area as bigfoot is to rural north California. It's one of the country's most enduring legends; stories of the Jersey Devil predate the United States itself.</p>
 <p>Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives we talk with documentary film maker Seth Breedlove about his latest movie "The Boggy Creek Monster". As well as some of his previous movies "The Minerva Monster" and "The Beast of Whitehall". These documentary films are all made by "Small Town Monsters". Small Town Monsters is an independent film series that explores lost and bizarre history around the United States. In addition to film, STM is also merchandise, and other media devoted to this same subject matter.</p>
 <p>The legend of the Boggy Creek Monster has long captivated the people of Fouke, Arkansas, a little town about 150 miles outside of Little Rock. It is said that Fouke is the first place that this cryptid was spotted. According to legend, the Boggy Creek Monster stands between seven and eight feet tall on two feet and weighs close to 300 pounds. Its chest, legs and arms are covered with thick, long hair.</p>
 <p>The first reported sightings go all the way back to 1834, when it is said that the large, hairy “wild man” was roaming in Arkansas. In the 1900s, sightings around Fouke became more frequent with residents spotting the monster more than 40 times in 1997 alone. It has been suggested that the animal is nocturnal, but a hunter reported a sighting in broad daylight in the Sulfur River WIldlife Area near Fouke in 2000.</p>
 <p>The Boggy Creek Monster has been subject of at least four different films, beginning with 1973’s <em>The Legend of Boggy Creek</em>. This movie, centered around Bobby Ford’s supposed encounter with the beast, played in drive-in theaters around the country and introduced millions to the legend that had never heard of this creature before. Mostly shot on location in Fouke, with additional scenes filmed in Texarkana and Shreveport, Louisiana, the film also served as a major economic boost to the region; many cast members were locals or nearby college students.</p>
 <p>The famous encounter that the film is based on occurred in 1971. Bobby and Elizabeth Ford claimed that the Boggy Creek Monster attacked their home late on the night of May 1. The monster, Elizabeth said, reached through her screen window, but was chased away by Bobby and Dan, his brother, who had just returned from a hunting trip. Unsatisfied, the monster returned shortly after midnight and tossed Bobby to the ground, the Fords say. Bobby was taken to the St. Michael Hospital in Texarkana and treated for large gashes across his back; he was suffering from mild shock when he arrived, according to newspaper reports (there were several papers covering the legend around this time). No traces of blood were found on the Ford’s home, but three-toed footprints were found near the house, scratches found on the porch, and damage sustained to a window and the house’s siding.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how recently while sifting through the remains of an Iron Age burial plot dating from 400 to 450 B.C. in what is today Germany, Bettina Arnold, an archaeologist and anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and others uncovered a cauldron that contained remnants of an alcohol brewed and buried with the deceased. So she decided to team up with Milwaukee's Lakefront Brewery to re-create the ancient brew, using a recipe inspired by evidence collected from the archaeological remains.</p>
 <p>Then,a remarkable 7,000-year-old megalithic site that served as an astronomical observatory has been found in Muduma village in Telangana, India. The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological findings in India over the last few decades. According to Times of India, the team of archeologists described it as  ''the only megalithic site in India, where a depiction of a star constellation has been identified''. The ancient observatory dates to 5,000 BC and the researchers believe that it is the earliest astronomical observatory discovered in India and perhaps even in the whole of South Asia. The site consists of around 80 huge menhirs (standing stones), which are 3.5 – 4 meters tall. There are also about 2000 alignment stones, which are 30-60cm tall. According to experts, no other excavation site in India has so many menhirs concentrated in such a small area. The maximum concentration of menhirs is located in the central portion of the monument.</p>
 <p>Then, a person relayed an interesting sighting they had in California to Lon Strickler at <a href="http://www.phantomsandmonsters.com/">Phantoms and Monsters</a>. According to the eye witness the creature looked very similar to the paintings of the “Ropen” of Indonesia. I would estimate it had about a 3-5 ft. wingspan. It was light tan, all leathery skin, and the most astonishing thing was that it had no feathers! I could see the wrinkles &amp; texture of its skin moving over its bones as it flew. The eyes were very large, round eyes, and it appeared to be young, or at least I had that impression because of its size and some of its features, like the tail and the bump on the back of its head were not as developed as those depicted of adult Ropen/Pterosaurs.</p>
 <p>Then, pupils at a school in Austria were evacuated because a rock they had on display was giving off radiation. The rock turned out to be a lump of uranium, the metallic element that is used to produce atomic bombs. Alarmingly, the uranium was giving off thousands of millisiverts of radiation into the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart School in Salzburg - a lot higher than what is given off naturally.</p>
 <p>Then, after the break Cam brings up the mysterious Texas Killing Fields. In 1986, the battered body of 13-year-old Krystal Jean Baker was found dumped under an interstate bridge in Chambers County, Texas. She had been beaten, raped and strangled to death, but it took 26 years for her killer to be brought to justice. Kevin Edison Smith, the man who choked the life out of the innocent girl, was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life without parole. The 45-year-old was spared the death penalty because investigators believed he may have been involved in the some of the other unsolved murders that have occurred in a 50-mile desolate area between Houston and Galveston dubbed the 'Highway of Hell'. Since the 1970s, more than 30 young women have mysteriously disappeared or been found murdered along Texas’ Interstate 45, in what has become the state’s most notorious killing spree. A mile from I-45, lies the 25-acre patch known as 'The Killing Fields', where the bodies of four young women have been found. Detectives have described the remote area as a perfect dumping ground for a serial killer, which has made investigating the cases so difficult. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off the show talking about how Australian researchers have discovered that peptides contained in the milk of Tasmanian devils can kill some of the most deadly bacterial and fungal infections, including golden staph. Then, Russian researchers have stumbled on the site of this lost weather station, along with a handful of wartime relics from the 1940s. Among the artifacts discovered on the island are objects bearing Nazi insignia and swastikas. Most importantly for the researchers, many of the items also appear to be marked and dated to give further confirmation that this is the real deal.</p>
 <p>Then, Cam re-tells a terrifying experience one camper had in Michigan with what is believed to be a Bigfoot like creature. Then, a recent article claims the Earth faces another ICE AGE within 15 years as Russian scientists discover that the Sun is cooling. Experts say that solar activity as low as it currently is has not been seen since the mini-ice age that took place between 1645 and 1715 – a period known as the Maunder Minimum where the entire Thames froze over. A new model has allowed experts to predict solar activity with more accuracy than ever before and it suggests that magnetic activity will fall by 60 per cent between 2030 and 2040.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives week talk with friend and author Joshua Cutchin about his latest book "<em>The Brimstone Deceit</em>". Witnesses the world over claim to see spirits, UFOs, Sasquatch, and other phenomena that are not supposed to exist. Most cannot believe their eyes, yet some of these observers have also detected evidence of a more ephemeral nature--odors abound, in particular the stench of brimstone. In the first book of its kind, Joshua Cutchin, author of the highly praised <em>A Trojan Feast, </em>documents these uncommon scents and poses a startling possibility... that smell is a sense ripe for deception. We trust our eyes and ears, but should we trust our noses?</p>
 <p>Prior to pursuing his dream of becoming a full-time author and musician in 2015, Joshua Cutchin served as Public Affairs Director of the University of Georgia Hugh Hodgson School of Music for three years. During his tenure at UGA, Joshua authored over one hundred articles, press releases, and blog posts.</p>
 <p>In addition to appearing in local media, his press releases have also been referenced and distributed by such media outlets as the Associated Press and National Public Radio. Before his time at UGA, Joshua provided content for the Georgia Symphony Orchestra (Marietta, GA), Athens Banner-Herald (Athens, GA), Walton Tribune (Monroe, GA), and Observer News Enterprise (Newton, NC).</p>
 <p> Joshua has appeared on a variety of paranormal programs discussing his work, including Coast to Coast AM, Mysterious Universe, Binnall of America, Radio Misterioso, and the Gralien Report. In 2015, Anomalist Books released his first book, A Trojan Feast.</p>
 <p>He is a recurring roundtable guest on the Where Did the Road Go? podcast, and made his public speaking debut at the December 2015 MUFON Georgia meeting. Since then, Joshua has been invited to speak at the 2016 ParaMania un-conference and the International Fortean Organization's 2016 FortFest.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a reeally astonishing trail cam footage showing a UFO followed by the mysterious appearance of a very large, mechanical-looking object has been sent to MUFON (case 79614) and reported on many UFO sites. Then, nuclear weapons are already scary enough, but when you dig deeper and find out how powerful the weapons truly are, they get even more terrifying. The weapons we’ve built after the first atomic bombs are so strong that you can basically use Hiroshima as a unit of measurement. The largest nuclear explosion in human history, the Tsar Bomba, detonated with a force of 50 megatons or the power of 3,333 Hiroshimas.</p>
 <p>Then, an eagle cam appears to have captured an ape-like creature walking around on the ground below, prompting speculation that it could be the elusive creature. The shadowy figure was filmed near the Platte River State Fish Hatchery in Beulah, Michigan, back in May, The Detroit Free Press reported. The camera had been set up to monitor a resident eagle family’s progress by the state’s Department of Natural Resources and outdoor website CarbonTV. It wasn’t until recently, however, that a CarbonTV editor stumbled across the video’s clip on a Bigfoot sighting website and highlighted it on theirs, said CarbonTV executive director of content and marketing Daniel Seliger. The footage has since gone viral with an edited version of it magnifying the creature as it walks, seemingly on two legs, around trees and other brush. Then, after the break Cam brings up some very interesting lesser known UFO crashes from around the world. Thank you for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how recently archaeologists were left baffled by the "strange" discovery of ancient Roman coins buried in the ruins of a castle in Japan. The four copper coins were retrieved from soil beneath Katsuren Castle on Okinawa Island, and were originally thought to be a hoax before their true provenance was revealed. Then, a recent study by Japanese researchers has added some much-needed extra data about the phenomenon of life after death. In 2014 a questionnaire was sent out to bereaved family members of cancer patients across Japan who died in hospital, palliative care units, or at home, in order to evaluate the quality of the end-of-life care they received. Part of that nationwide survey asked about deathbed visions. Remarkably, of 2,221 survey responses, the researchers found that visions of dead loved ones were reported in 463 cases (21%). Then, a Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia couple were scratching their heads after discovering an odd-looking creature they described as a “jellified leech of some type.” Then, a 21-year-old Australian tradesman has been bitten by a venomous spider on the penis for a second time. The man was using a portable toilet on a Sydney building site on Tuesday, when he suffered a repeat of the incident five months ago.</p>
 <p>After the break, Kyle brings up the unusual mysteries and folklore that surround Mount Shasta. It is believed by many to be one of the sacred places found on Earth and it is called by some The Magical Mountain, it is the majestic Mt. Shasta, located in the Cascade Mountain Range of Northern California. Rising up from the range of picturesque mountains, in Siskiyou County, to a height of over 14,162 feet above sea level it ranks as one of the largest dormant (last eruption was incorrectly reported as being in 1786) strato-compound volcanoes (it is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire) in the continental USA. Mt Shasta, often seen as a very mysterious volcanic mountain, geologically has 4 cones stratovolcanic overlapping cones, not the usual 2. Legends and mysteries abound about the ethereal aura felt and seen by some who have trekked near, around and on the natural wonder. Native people have always held the mountain as a sacred area and in recent decades New Age believers see the mountain as having a mystical power that exudes peace and harmony. UFO proponents believe a secret alien base is located deep within the mountain. Others claim that there is a secret underground crystal city occupied by the lost tribe of Lemuria.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a robot has been arrested while taking part in a political rally in Russia, after police intervened to prevent it from interacting with the public. According to reports, the activist robot – called Promobot, and manufactured by a Russian company of the same name – was detained by police as it interspersed with the crowd at a rally in support of Russian parliamentary candidate Valery Kalachev in Moscow. Then, an amateur archaeologist has tracked down hundreds of prehistoric rock engravings in Scotland in what has been described as a “phenomenal” contribution to the understanding of Britain’s earliest artworks. Then, a 31-year-old Ohio resident Amy Kovacs told Cryptozoology News that she was in her front yard talking to her husband and a friend when she spotted the unidentified flying creature. Then, a man in Marion County, Florida wrote Lon Strickler an email to his popular blog "Phantoms and Monsters" about the family of Bigfoot that he believes is living on his property. After the break Kyle and Cam bring up the interesting story surrounding the top secret Alien/Human base located in Dulce, New Mexico. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how several cryptic posts from the Facebook page of a group known as the 'Flomo Klowns' put two Southern Alabama schools on lock down for a while Thursday morning. The Flomaton Police Department received information from a parent that her child had been sent threatening messages on Facebook from the group. Then, the world is still vulnerable to a potentially catastrophic asteroid strike, according to President Barack Obama's chief science adviser. NASA has made substantial progress in finding the asteroids that pose the biggest threat to Earth, but there's still a lot of work to do, said John Holdren, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy. Then, an Arkansas witness at Bella Vista and his wife rushed to a bedroom window after hearing “jet-like” sounds and watched a triangle-shaped object just 100 feet over the rooftop. Then, evoking visions of mad scientists, French researchers are set to revive a mega-virus dormant for 30,000 years that they discovered in the permafrost of the Russian Arctic. After the break the Kyle brings up some unusual real life stories of serial killers of the animal kingdom. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how a 22-year-old British student has invented a mobile fridge that could save millions of lives across the world. Will Broadway's "Isobar" has been designed to keep vaccines at the ideal temperature while in transit in developing countries. And Will doesn't plan to make money from his creation. His focus is to get it to people who need it, which is why he won't be trying to get a patent. Then, archeologists working on the Dampier archipelago off Australia’s north-west coast have found evidence of stone houses dating back 9,000 years – to the end of the last ice age – building the case for the area to get a world heritage listing. Circular stone foundations were discovered in on Rosemary Island, the outermost of 42 islands that make up the archipelago. The islands and the nearby Burrup peninsula are known as Murujuga – a word meaning “hip bones sticking out” – in the language of the Ngarluma people.</p>
 <p>Then, Hitachi Ltd. started trials of its EMIEW3 humanoid robot at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on Friday to aid foreign visitors to Japan. During the trials through December in the airport’s domestic Terminal 2, the robot will communicate with passengers in Japanese and English at a designated information center as well as display information. The industrial conglomerate is hoping to enable the 90-centimeter-tall humanoid robot with autonomous capabilities to guide users to destinations starting around December. Then, researchers at U.C. San Diego have created the first nanofish, the New Scientist reports—a magnet-powered bot that they hope to use for targeted delivery of medication, non-invasive surgery and single-cell manipulation. Developed by Jinxing Li and his team at the University of California, these new nanobots are 100 times smaller than a grain of sand and consist of tiny gold and nickel segments that are connected with silver hinges. An external magnet is used to manipulate the nickel and create a waving motion to propel the bot forward. The speed and direction of the little swimmer is determined by the orientation and strength of the magnetic field. After the break Cam brings up some unusual Cryptids of the Caribbean. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show talking about how Thursday, September 1st An unmanned SpaceX rocket, topped by an Israeli satellite, was being prepped for a test firing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida when something went wrong. The 604-ton Falcon 9 rocket was being fueled with a potent mix of liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene propellant when an explosion quickly enveloped the launch pad in flames. But that's not the strange part. The strange part is that a video has emerged of what appears to be an unidentified flying object zooming behind the Falcon 9 Space X rocket moments before it exploded. Then, an Arkansas witness at Little Rock reported watching an “intense white, spiraling, flat, circular light that moved at incredible speed. Then, new evidence shows that Earth was just missed  by a 180 foot Asteroid which no one saw coming until the last minute. Then, what will the vacation of the future look like? To that end, <a href="http://Expedia.co.uk">Expedia.co.uk</a> recently released its Holiday of the Future, which has some enlightening predictions about how technology will ease our travel woes. After the break Kyle and Cam discuss some strange police encounters ranging from ghosts to UFOs to Cryptids. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the boys talk about the Hound of Mons. A fascinating chronicle was published in 1919 by Canadian veteran F. J. Newhouse, describing the story of the gigantic otherworldly hound that mauled over British soldiers in No Man’s Land. The publishing claimed that this hound wasn’t your typical Hellhound or phantom, but the intentional creation of a horrific German experiment. According to Newhouse, Dr. Gottlieb Hochmuller had been performing an array of experiments to develop a powerful weapon to sway the war in Germany’s favor. He roamed from one asylum to another, and finally found a man who had gone mad in his hatred for England. He then extracted the brain out of the madman with the consent of the German Government and inserted it into the skull of a Siberian wolfhound. While the madman died, the dog, with tender nursing, grew powerful and notorious. Once ready, it was set free to hunt down British soldiers in the battlefield of Mons. But is there any truth in this unbelievable legend? Perhaps yes.</p>
 <p>The days of nightmare began on November 14, 1914, when Captain Yeskes and four associates from the London Fusiliers went to patrol the No Man’s Land. They never returned. After many days there cadavers were recovered, with teeth marks on their throats. Nights later a petrifying howl was heard from the darkness. From then on, more and more soldiers would die in the No Man’s Land, with the same canine imprints on their throats. Every now and then, a howl was heard, and sentries dreadingly noticed a big gray brute tread the grounds of the No Man’s Land. Days after, the hound disappeared, never to be seen again.</p>
 <p>At that time, civilians were suspicious of the story, and rightly so, after all, this seems to be something right out of an Edgar Allan Poe horror fiction! Newhouse claimed that certain secret ‘papers’ had been released from Hochmuller’s house, which proved the legend. Unfortunately, the papers were never again heard of.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about <em>Zenkerella insignis</em>, the critter caught on Bioko, is one of the world's most ancient and mysterious mammals. Until now, it was known only by its fossils and 11 scattered specimens, many of which had been languishing in natural history collections for over 100 years. Researchers who were interested in the species (and there aren't many) had little to go on aside from a hind limb here, a few teeth there. No scientist in history has ever seen it alive. Then, according to biologist Elizabeth Congdon, an assistant professor at Bethune-Cookman University, the state of Florida could have a serious capybara problem—and it might be the fault of exotic pet owners. Then, it's been a year since two treasure hunters claimed to have found a Nazi gold train buried under Poland and yet no Nazi gold train has actually been produced. That isn't stopping a team of 35 people, who plan to resume the hunt Monday, Deutsche Welle reports. Then, care to learn more about 400-foot tsunamis on Mars? Now you can, after Nasa announced it is making all its publicly funded research available online for free. The space agency has set up a new public web portal called Pubspace, where the public can find Nasa-funded research articles on everything from the chances of life on one of Saturn’s moons to the effects of space station living on the hair follicles of astronauts. After the break Cam and Kyle talk about the iconic "Skinwalker Ranch". In northern Utah there exists a “ranch” so strange, so bizarre, that the <em>National Institute for Discovery Science </em>(owned by Las Vegas businessman and billionaire Bob Bigelow) purchased it solely for scientific research purposes. Located in the <em>Uintah Basin</em> near the town of <em>Fort Duchesne</em>, paranormal phenomenon such as strange creatures, bizarre objects, flying black triangles, animal mutilations, and telepathic messages, have been reported on the 480 acre <em>Skinwalker Ranch </em>for hundreds of years.  It is estimated that over half the population in the area surrounding the ranch have witnessed unusual paranormal activity on, or near what became known as the “<em>Strangest Place on Earth</em>”.  Even the local Ute Indians believe the land to be cursed – and tribe members are strictly forbidden to enter the property. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of expanded perspectives Cam and Kyle start off talking about how giant traps called desert kites—some of which are 8,000 years old—were built across animal migration routes by Old World pastoralists. Then, last Sunday, Scotland achieved something great - for the first time on record, wind power alone generated 106 percent of Scotland’s electricity needs in a single day. Environmental group WWF Scotland has just confirmed that on 7 August 2016, wind turbines in Scotland pumped 39,545 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity into the National Grid, while the nation's homes, businesses, and industry needed just 37,202 MWh. Then, most of us are pretty good at acting on the fly: swerving to avoid an obstacle in the road, ducking to keep from being hit, or reflexively catching a fly ball. We can do this because the brain is constantly running simulations of the physics involved as we scan our environment, according to a new series of brain imaging studies. All that processing is done by a handful of regions involved in planning actions, which kick into gear whenever we watch physical events unfold around us. The team responsible for the new studies has dubbed it the brain’s “physics engine,” and suggest it could help design more nimble robots. They described their work in a new paper in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Then, the term <em>foo fighter</em> was used by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II to describe various UFOs or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific Theater of Operations. Though "foo fighter" initially described a type of UFO reported, (named by the U.S. 415th Night Fighter Squadron) the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period. Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, incidents were reported throughout WWII. Witnesses often assumed that the foo fighters were secret weapons employed by the enemy, but they remained unidentified post-war and were reported by both Allied and Axis forces.  The foo fighter experiences of Allied pilots were taken very seriously. Most of the information about the issue has never been released by military intelligence. Kyle relays two such sightings. After the break, Cam brings up some very interesting encounters with little people or face folk. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how one of the last known groups of woolly mammoths died out because of a lack of drinking water, scientists believe. The Ice Age beasts were living on a remote island off the coast of Alaska, and scientists have dated their demise to about 5,600 years ago. They believe that a warming climate caused lakes to become shallower, leaving the animals unable to quench their thirst. Then, what do you so with land that’s been rendered inhabitable by humans? The Ukrainian government has decided the best use of the 1,600 square mile “exclusion zone” surrounding the former Chernobyl nuclear power station is to build one the world’s largest solar power plants, according to Electrek. Then, Australia is to shift its longitude and latitude to address a gap between local co-ordinates and those from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Local co-ordinates, used to produce maps and measurements, and global ones differ by more than 1m. Then, Cam brings up an unusual Gnome encounter in the deep dark woods. After the break, Kyle details the horrific story of the Donner Party. In the spring of 1846, a group of nearly 90 emigrants left Springfield, Illinois, and headed west. Led by brothers Jacob and George Donner, the group attempted to take a new and supposedly shorter route to California. They soon encountered rough terrain and numerous delays, and they eventually became trapped by heavy snowfall high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Purportedly reduced to cannibalism to survive through the winter, only half of the original group reached California the following year. Their story quickly spread, and before long the term “Donner Party” became synonymous with one of humanity’s most ingrained taboos. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how Amazon is partnering with the British government to expand its testing of delivery drones, paving the way for commercial air deliveries for UK residents. The expanded testing, announced today in a press release, involves Amazon working with the UK Civil Aviation Authority to focus on operating drones outside of the line of sight of pilots, improving sensors for obstacle detection and avoidance, and having one pilot operate a team of multiple, semi-autonomous drones in unison. The project is the latest regulatory victory for Prime Air, the online retailer's ambitious program designed to bring cheaper and more forward-thinking delivery logistics in-house. Then, could what happened in Fukushima happen 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of New York City? That’s what many activists and former nuclear regulators fear for the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear power plant that has operated in Westchester County for more than four decades. The plant provides a good chunk of the energy needs for the surrounding area, but it has come under fire in recent years for safety and environmental concerns, including its warming of the Hudson River and a recent case of bolts missing in one of its reactors. Two of the plant’s three reactor units are currently operating on expired licenses, with the state of New York having denied parent company Entergy’s extension requests due to suspected violations of the federal Clean Water Act. Then, a 36 year old man tells a terrifying encounter he had near Homers Gap, Pennsylvania with what appeared to be an upright walking wolf that resembled the werewolves in the movie "Underworld" in the summer of 1998. Then, a flame of American 90s childhood went out on Tuesday with the death of Miss Cleo, the famous infomercial tarot card clairvoyant with the turbans, faux Jamaican accent and over-the-top dramas she solved with her tarot cards. Miss Cleo, real name Youree Dell Cleomili Harris, died in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday, aged 53. She had been battling colon cancer. After the break, Cam brings up the disturbing tale of the Axe Man of Austin.  A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed upon the city of Austin, Texas, during the years 1884 and 1885. The killer's name originated with the writer O. Henry. The series of eight axe murders was referred to by contemporary sources as the "Servant Girl Murders." According to <em>Texas Monthly</em>, seven women (five black, two white) and one black man were murdered. Additionally, six women and two men were seriously injured. All the victims were attacked indoors while asleep in their bed. Five of the women were dragged, unconscious but still alive, and killed outdoors. Three of the women were severely mutilated while outdoors. All the victims were posed in a similar manner. Six of the murdered women had a "sharp object" inserted into their ears. The series of murders ended with the killing of two white women, Eula Phillips, age 17, and Susan Hancock, who was attacked while sleeping in the bed of her 16-year-old daughter on the night of 24 December 1885. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how the Solar Impulse 2 is the record breaking aircraft that achieved the first ever trans-Atlantic flight powered solely by the sun. With a wingspan of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, and weighing a mere 2,300kg, the plane itself is a technological marvel. While it’s certainly not the world’s first solar plane, it is the first to fly for 5 consecutive days and nights without any traditional fuels. Then, researchers at Case Western Reserve University have combined tissues from a sea slug with flexible 3-D printed components to build "biohybrid" robots that crawl like sea turtles on the beach. Then, researchers have posted a fascinating study where you can actually hear how our ancestors spoke 8,000 years ago. Scientists from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford have managed to reproduce some of the words that originated from a language which disappeared from the face of the Earth thousands of years ago. Then, an Oregon witness at Lebanon reported watching a fast-moving object crossing his property just four feet off of the ground that created a water-like distortion in the air. After the break Kyle gets into a lesser known alleged crash of a UFO in the great state of Missouri back in the spring of 1941. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show talking about how the FBI said Tuesday it is no longer investigating the enduring mystery of the skyjacker known as D.B. Cooper, nearly 45 years after he vanished out the back of a Boeing 727 into a freezing Northwest rain wearing a business suit, a parachute and a pack with $200,000 in cash. Calling the investigation one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency's history, the FBI Seattle field office said in an email it was time to focus on other cases. The agency said it will preserve evidence from the case at its Washington, D.C., headquarters, but it doesn't want further tips unless people find parachutes or Cooper's money. Then, could the new and popular app called Pokemon Go really be a government surveillance psyop project? Then, the transition from hunter-gatherer to sedentary farming 10,000 years ago occurred in multiple neighbouring but genetically distinct populations according to research by an international team including UCL. Then, regenerative dental fillings that allow teeth to heal themselves have been developed by researchers, potentially eliminating the need for root canals. The treatment, developed by scientists from the University of Nottingham and Harvard University, earned a prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry after judges described it as a “new paradigm for dental treatments.” Then, a Tennessee witness at Memphis reported watching two V-shaped UFOs “hanging” in the sky over an interstate highway. After the breaks the guys get into one of the most popular videos ever recorded when it comes to Bigfoot. The iconic Patterson/Gimlin Film. The Patterson/Gimlin film is a famous short motion picture of an unidentified subject the filmmakers said was a Bigfoot. The footage was shot in 1967, and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it. Several university based studies and professional evaluations have concluded the subject cannot possibly be a man in an ape suit. However, others have judged it to be a hoax staged with a man in an ape suit. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show by talking about two people in Oregon County, Mississippi say they came across an unknown animal that looked like a mix between a dog and a kangaroo. Then, an unusual story about a headless railway conductor seen patrolling a particular section of track looking for his missing head taken from the Chicago Tribune newspaper January 15, 1890. Then, Kit Parker a bio-engineer at Harvard a recently created a small robot stingray that uses real living rat cells. Parker's robotic stingray is tiny—a bit more than half an inch long—and weighs only 10 grams. But it glides through liquid with the very same undulating motion used by fish like real stingrays and skates. The robot is powered by the contraction of 200,000 genetically engineered rat heart-muscle cells grown on the underside of the bot. Even stranger, Parker's team developed the robot to follow bright pulses of light, allowing it to smoothly twist and turn through obstacle courses. Then, numerous governments around the world are slowly coping with the idea that the worldwide population has a right to know whether or not we are alone in the universe. In fact, the disclosure movement has never been as strong as it is today with countless Military officers, government officials, and astronauts speaking out about the existence of alien life and Alien spacecraft. Recently the FBI released some of these documents, and whats on them will shock you. After the break Cam brings up one of the strangest missing person stories in recent years. Born in 1938, Michael Clark Rockefeller was the son of New York governor and later Vice President Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, and was a fourth generation member of the Rockefeller family, one of the richest, most powerful, and influential families in America at the time. Michael had long had a passionate interest in art, especially in primitive and tribal art, and in 1957 helped established the first ever museum solely dedicated to such art, the Museum of Primitive Art, in Manhattan. Rockefeller was also an adventurer at heart, and yearned to travel to faraway lands and meet exotic tribes. It was this profound interest in art and his desire to experience another world that would eventually bring Michael Rockefeller across the world to the remote and little understood, mysterious land of what was then Dutch New Guinea. While exploring in that area he disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Netherlands New Guinea. In 2014, Carl Hoffman published a book that went into detail about the inquest into his killing, in which villagers and tribal elders admit to Rockefeller being killed after he swam to shore in 1961. Despite these claims, no remains or other proof of his death have ever been discovered.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how in the ancient Mesopotamian city of Uruk, residents enjoyed many benefits of modern life. The city, located in modern-day Iraq, was home to massive ziggurats that would rival any of today's modern skyscrapers for sheer monumentality. People in Uruk exchanged goods for money, played board games, and sent each other letters on clay tablets using a writing system called cuneiform. They were also paid for their labor in beer. We know this because pay stubs were incredibly common documents at the time, and one such pay stub is now in the possession of the British Museum. Then, a man describes and odd triangle shaped UFO seen near some power lines by his home in New Hampshire back in the 80's. Then, in case you ever find yourself in the little town of Tonopah, Nevada make sure to check out the infamous Clown Motel, which, if not creepy enough in its own right, sits next to a century-old miner's graveyard. Then, Finnish archaeologists working near the village of Patapatani in Bolivia, recently found the remains of at least six individuals buried under an Aymara funerary tower which was built, thousands of years ago for people of royal status in the ancestral culture. Interestingly two of the skeletons were of particular interest. One of the skeletons belonged to a woman and the other one of her baby, nothing out of the ordinary other than the fact that both of them had freakishly large elongated heads that were not the result of cranial deformation. After the break, Kyle brings up one of scariest human beings to ever walk the earth. Remember those dark nights from your childhood when you were afraid of the boogeyman? He never did leap out of your closet, but that doesn’t mean all monsters are make-believe. Meet Albert Fish: a real-life nightmare, who preyed upon children as if they were food. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p> </p>
 <p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys discuss one of world's strangest mysteries. The Oak Island Money Pit.</p>
 <p>In 1795, a teenager named Daniel McGinnis found an oval-shaped recession in the ground on the island. With little evidence that there was anything to be discovered, McGinnis started digging in the area and subsequently hit wooden planks every ten feet. The discovery of the planks led McGinnis and his friends to believe the pit was man-made and they began what would become a long-standing tradition of treasure seeking in the area.</p>
 <p>From the beginning of the 19th century onward, many companies formed to begin their own digging expeditions in the pit, each discovering more "evidence" and attributing new theories to the region. Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Franklin Roosevelt were at one point each involved in the hunt and held their own theories as to the pit’s contents.</p>
 <p>Some believed pirate treasure lay just below the next layer of soil. Others believed Marie Antoinette’s lost jewels were surely buried there right after the French Revolution. Another theory even posited that Francis Bacon had stored documents in the pit proving himself as the author of Shakespeare’s plays. There are many other theories one big one is that "The Arc Of the Covenant" lies at the bottom.</p>
 <p>Despite the wild theories, little has ever come out of the pit. Everything ever found in the pit has been attributed to some treasure theory. A cavern found during the dig was deemed a booby trap. Another tunnel leading out of the pit to Smith’s cove was deemed a secret floodway. Any wood found in tunnel was immediately considered a part of the pit’s foundation.</p>
 <p>However, just enough evidence has been found to keep people digging. Among the biggest discoveries were a set of stone inscriptions found 90 feet below the earth. Symbols on the stones were translated as “forty feet below lie two million pounds.” Even more promising, was the alleged discovery of a few gold pieces.</p>
 <p>As with many of the discoveries from the pit, the inscriptions and gold themselves disappeared, and have not been seen in over fifty years, thus little modern investigation on them can be done. Researchers have even begun to formulate theories as to where the inscriptions and gold are now, creating yet a new mystery tangent to follow. This of course, is the story of the Money Pit. Each new theory or discovery comes with yet more mystery and controversy and less hard evidence or treasure.</p>
 <p>Further complicating matters of the pit, excavations have now gone 190 feet into the earth since the late 18th century. In many ways, the expeditions themselves have become a part of the history of Oak Island. It is often difficult to discern what the creators of the pit left and what belonged to treasure hunters, and a stone inscription marked “1701” is even considered by some to be a hoax left by past hunters.</p>
 <p>Whether the pit is a natural sinkhole, a booby-trapped pit filled with gems, or one of the worlds greatest follies may forever remain a mystery. In 2010, a final treasure hunt was initiated, found nothing, and the government passed the Oak Island Act, banning all commercial treasure hunting on the island. However, in 2011 a new Oak Island Treasure Act invited the hunt to continue, with permission granted from the Minister of Natural Resources.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off talking about how three amateur archaeologists recently found the largest Viking gold hoard ever discovered in Denmark. At 900 grams (1.948 pounds), the hoard consists of seven beautifully worked bracelets, six of gold and one of silver. Then, one of Indiana’s most haunted hotspots has been scaring off midnight visitors and road workers alike for hundreds of years, but now the mysterious Grave in the Middle of the Road has gotten even stranger after the discovery of not one, but seven bodies under the single headstone. Then, if sharks at the Pacific atoll of Palmyra used Google Maps, they'd see a lot of red dashes for traffic between 7 and 8 o'clock every evening. Shark traffic in and out of the lagoon at Palmyra Atoll, halfway between Hawaii and American Samoa, peaks during this hour, according to new research published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. Then, recently a woman named Joanne Barnaby went mushroom picking in a forest near Fort Smith in the Canadian Northwest Territories. It was an inauspicious beginning to what would end up being a 12-hour ordeal, one involving a desperate wolf, swarms of mosquitoes, an unwitting bear cub—and a can of beer. After the break Cam brings up the unusual and mystifying Hoia Baciu Forest. The Hoia-Baciu Forest ( World’s Most Haunted Forest ) is situated near Cluj-Napoca, Romania covers an area of over 250 hectares and is often referred to as the Bermuda Triangle of the country. Hoia Baciu Forest ( World’s Most Haunted Forest ), has a reputation for intense paranormal activity and unexplained events. Reports have included, ghost sightings, unexplained apparitions, faces appearing in photographs that were not visible with the naked eye, and in the 1970s, UFO sightings were reported. Visitors to the forest often report intense feelings of anxiety and the feeling of being constantly watched. Moreover, the local vegetation is somehow bizarre in appearance, like something out of a make-believe story with strangely shaped trees, and unexplained charring on tree stumps and branches. The forest was named after a shepherd that disappeared in the area with a flock of two hundred sheep. Most people who live near the forest are afraid to enter it due to the stories and legends that have been handed down. They believe that those who visit the site will never return back home. Many of the locals who have been brave enough to venture into the forest complained of physical harm, including rashes, nausea, vomiting, migraines, burns, scratches, anxiety, and other unusual sensations. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off by talking about a recent reptilian sighting. Then, the home in Long Island, New York where the Amityville Horror took place is now back on the market. Then, deep in the jungles of southeast Asia, archaeologists have rediscovered the remains of an invisible kingdom that may have been the template for Angkor Wat. Then, a private company wants U.S. clearance to fly to the moon with it's new MX1 Lunar Lander. After the break Kyle brings up some unusual Phantom Train sightings from around the world. Are these truly apparitions of days gone past or are they somehow a ripple in time that much like a scratched record, keeps repeating or replaying itself time and time again? All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>The story of King Arthur is known throughout the world. The fabled Camelot, Sir Bedivere casting Excalibur into the lake and Arthur’s secret burial at the isle of Avalon: these are just a few of the enchanting themes in the ancient saga that historians have long considered to be pure fantasy. Now, in <em>The Lost Tomb of King Arthur</em>, Graham Phillips presents compelling evidence that such legends were actually based on real events. During a quest lasting over twenty-five years, he has followed a fascinating trail of historical clues showing Arthur to have been a living warrior who led the Britons around the year 500. He has discovered that the legendary Camelot, Excalibur and Avalon were based on a real city, a real sword and a real island. And, most astonishing of all, Graham has found what he claims to be the location where Arthur was finally buried. An ancient manuscript still persevered at Oxford University, Graham believes, reveals the whereabouts of King Arthur’s long-lost tomb. Not in the South West town of Glastonbury, as the popular myth maintains, but at an ancient site in the isolated countryside of central England. With the help of archaeologists employing the very the latest scientific equipment, Graham now has what he is certain is the final proof that this disregarded Dark Age text really does reveal the last resting place of the man behind the legend of King Arthur.</p>
 <p>Graham Phillips has been one of Britain’s bestselling non-fiction authors for over twenty years. In the 1980s, after working as a radio journalist and broadcaster for the BBC and editing a popular monthly magazine, Graham turned his talents to investigating unsolved historical mysteries. He has since written twelve books which are in print around the world and have been published in many different languages.</p>
 <p>Graham Phillips has never been afraid of controversy. In 1995 he made headlines around the world, and created a storm in the Vatican that even involved the Pope himself, when he discovered a lost artifact that may have been the original Holy Grail. His first solo book, <em>The Search for the Grail</em>, told the fascinating story of this modern-day Grail quest.</p>
 <p>Graham’s latest books are <em>Alexander the Great: Murder in Babylon</em> which examines the mysterious death of history’s most renowned soldier, <em>The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant</em>, in which Graham goes in search of the lost Ark, <em>Merlin and the Discovery of Avalon in the New World</em>, a personal quest to discover the truth behind the Merlin legend, and <em>The End of Eden</em> which investigates an ancient comet that may have shaped civilization.</p>
 <p>Critics often wonder how Graham has managed to solve so many historical enigmas. The answer is that he employs a hands-on, investigative approach to his research that gives him a cutting-edge advantage. By collating evidence from many different subject areas, such as archaeology, history and Egyptology, he is able to gain an overall perspective that those tied to a particular discipline are often prevented from doing. More often than not, he has simply applied himself to a mystery that academics have been unwilling, or even afraid to touch.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about how a man in Clarke County, Alabama says he and his family are “tired of dealing” with a Bigfoot creature and are threatening to kill it unless officials come to “capture and remove it”. Then, the elusive, deep-sea-dwelling giant squid, with eyes the size of basketballs, may be larger than it has gotten credit for. In fact, the monster cephalopod may grow to be longer than a school bus, researchers say. Specimens recognizable as giant squid (<em>Architeuthis dux</em>) have been found washed up onshore since at least 1639. However, these sea monsters — which some people say inspired the legend of the giant kraken, though not all scientists agree — are so elusive that they were largely thought to be mythical until they were first photographed alive in their natural environment in 2004. Then, a team of young Japanese engineers is developing a flying car with the goal of launching it in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The futuristic vehicle  dubbed Skydrive  is fitted with three wheels, a motor and four rotors, enabling it to take off and land vertically from public roads without the need of a runway. Measuring only 9.5 feet by 4.3 feet, Skydrive claims to be the world’s smallest flying car, with a target top flight speed of 62 mph, while travelling up to 32 feet above the ground. Then, In India, witch hunting dates back hundreds of years. It emanated in the Morigaon district of Assam which is now infamously known as the ‘Indian Capital of Black Magic’. People from far-flung areas would come here to learn 'witchcraft'. Even today, witch hunting is being practiced in the State and has become a burning issue, where predominantly women fall prey to this heinous crime. After the break we talk about and listen to some strange encounters several of our listeners have had.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off the show talking about how researchers claim that the Burmese python may no longer be Florida's scariest invasive species. Recently, three Nile crocodiles were captured near Miami, and they say it's possible more of the man-eating reptiles are still out there, although no one can say for sure. Then, a man claims that he saw two birds “the size of airplanes”. Then, encounters with shadow figures go far back in history, from shadowy monk like beings with hooded cloaks to the infamous "hat man" of more recent years.  For the most part, the encounters are very disturbing for the witnesses and include feelings of fear and outright terror. Even more frightening are the cases of repeated encounters with these dark beings, cases wherein the shadow figure seems to be dwelling in the home of the victim, manifesting on a regular basis and often growing increasingly active and aggressive. Then, a Washington witness at Battle Ground reported watching what appeared to be a military helicopter escorting a cigar-shaped UFO very close to ground level. The incident occurred beginning at 11:20 p.m. on March 21, 2016, and was reported to MUFON the following day. After the break Cam brings up the many stories and sightings through Norway and abroad of mysterious Troll sightings. Are they real? And is there an active cover up by a few countries who know more than we think? Are certain sections of Norway closed off from the outside world in order to protect and not to anger the Trolls? All this and more on this weeks installment of Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys star off the show by talking about how recently an abandoned oil tanker has washed up on the shores of Liberia in west Africa, prompting an investigation – and speculation over the fate of the ship’s crew. Then, the world of archaeology was electrified last year by the news that Tutankhamun’s tomb could contain hidden chambers possibly containing the remains and riches of Queen Nefertiti. It was a story that seemed to have everything: false walls, buried treasure, at least one mummy – and new hope for Egypt’s ailing tourist industry. There was just one problem: the announcement now seems to be unfounded. But scientists say the evidence, based on new research, is being suppressed by the government in Cairo. Then, the U.S. Air Force is looking to fund the development of a system that allows it to easily convert any of its manned aircraft into robot-piloted planes, potentially making huge portions of its existing fleet fully autonomous. Then, the consequences of not getting enough sleep are evident to all of us—and yet we’re constantly staying up later than what our internal biological clocks are telling us. A new study shows the elusive nature of what’s to blame. Then,  a strange new report about a 'frog as big as a goat' supposedly sighted one day by diver Duncan Macdonald while underwater in Loch Ness during the late 1800s. After the break, Kyle brings up the mysterious disappearance of three lighthouse workers in the Flannan Islands. In December 1900 three lighthouse-keepers, Thomas Marshall, James Ducat and Donald McArthur, on the lonely outcrop of the Flannan Isles, approx 20 miles from the Outer Hebrides, western Scotland, disappeared without trace. No solution to their disappearance has ever been found, and for over a 100 years now this case has been of endless fascination to those of us who love unsolved mysteries. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a fantastic week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start offtalking about the Large Hadron Collider, a 17-mile superconducting machine designed tosmash protons together at close to the speed of light, went offlineovernight. Engineers investigating the mishap found the charredremains of a furry creature near a gnawed-through power cable.Then, nimble-fingered robots that exactly mimic themovements of a human hand could soon be used tohelp decommission nuclear powerstations. Remote-controlled robots with hand-like manipulatorsare used in many situations that are difficult or dangerous forhumans, such as bomb disposal. Then, a Kansas witness atClearwater recalled a UFO incident from the 60s when she and twofamily members had an encounter with a disc-shaped UFO that shot abeam of light inside their vehicle. Then, the ancient skeletonknown as Kennewick Man is related to modern Native American tribes,the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Wednesday, opening theprocess for returning to a tribe for burial one of the oldest andmost complete set of bones ever found in North America. TheNorthwestern Division of the corps said its decision was based on areview of new information, particularly recently published DNA andskeletal analyses. The corps, which owns the remains, said theskeleton is now covered by the Native American Graves Protectionand Repatriation Act. After the break, Kyle brings up one of themost mysterious missing person cases ever "D.B. Cooper". Tothis day, no one knows his real name but on Nov. 24, 1971, everyonein America was talking about the mysterious man who calledhimself D.B. Cooper. That day, Cooper hijacked NorthwestAirlines Flight 305 and its 36 passengers using a briefcase that hesaid contained a bomb. He was never seen again! Thanks forlistening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start out talking about how it's incredible that it escaped notice for so long, but scientists have just discovered a massive, 9,500 square-kilometer reef system at the mouth of the Amazon river. And it’s home to some truly bizarre life forms. Then, Jonathan Bloch at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and his colleagues have been studying 21-million-year-old sediments in Panama that were deposited on the North American side before the isthmus formed. They found seven teeth belonging to a South American monkey. Next, a sighting of a Leprechaun back in 2013 near Detroit is described and a Dogman sighting in Pennsylvania from 1976 is discussed. Finally, Hillary Clinton says that if elected President of the United States, she will look into the UFO phenomenon. After the  break Cam talks about a strange river in Australia and the odd events surrounding it. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start off by talking about how radioactive boars are running wild and breeding uncontrollably in the northern region of Japan contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Then, a new 3D printing technique from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory has allowed researchers to “print” all of the parts of a robot, both solid parts like the body and liquid components such as hydraulic pumps, at the same time. Then, a Netherlands witness at Soesterberg recalled a UFO encounter in the military from 1991 that left him traumatized. Then, back in 1977 Astronomer Jerry Ehman was using the Ohio State University’s Big Ear Radio Telescope to sweep the sky for possible signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. When He found something. While pointing towards a grouping of stars called Chi Sagittarii on 15 August, he received a powerful blast of radio waves that lasted for 72 seconds. He circled it on the readout and wrote: “Wow!” Now researcher Antonio Paris thinks that it could have been two previously unknown Comets. Then, a man claims he recently saw an 8-foot bipedal creature in Southeast Australia and the world's largest Stone Sphere was just discovered in Bosnia. After the break we talk about one of the most bizarre cases simply known as The Vampire of Cinkota. Bela Kiss was a Hungarian serial killer. He is thought to have murdered at least 24 young women and attempted to pickle them in giant metal drums that he kept on his property. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Expanded Perspectives, we discuss our trip to the 29th annual Ozark Mountain UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, as we do the show live from Cam and Kyle's mobile airship cruising back to the Drone Star State. Joining us on our journey is Micah Hanks of The Gralien Report, as we discuss the unique people we met over the course of the weekend, which included Erich von Daniken, Whitley Streiber, Nick Pope, Richard Dolan, Linda Moulton Howe, and many others. Also in the news, what "really" happened at Easter Island, and has science offered new theories about what led to the demise of it's islanders? We discuss all of this on this special "report from the road" on Expanded Perspectives.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the boys bring up a recent Tasmanian Tiger sighting, the second in only a few months near South Gippsland, Australia. Then, a man in Belvedere, Tennessee claims that three people saw a white and hairy bipedal creature. Next, Radar experts are casting doubt on claims that King Tutankhamun's tomb contains hidden, undiscovered chambers — and they're calling for more data to be released. Radar experts not affiliated with the project, and they said they doubt the validity of these claims. Some of these experts noted that the geology of the Valley of the Kings, which contains many natural voids, makes it difficult for radar to distinguish archaeological features from natural ones. Then, a Georgia witness at Cumming recalled a UFO event from 2013 where a black, rectangular-shaped object was seen flying low and blocking out the stars. Finally during the news portion of the show Cam brings up how a new site at Point Rosee, is the second where there is strong evidence of Viking settlements in the New World. The first, at L’Anse aux Meadows , also in Newfoundland but hundreds of miles north of Point Rosee, was discovered in 1960. The hearth at Point Rosee is surrounded by the remnants of a rectangular turf wall, says the National Geographic article announcing the find. The hearth itself is just a boulder with a depression in front of it, surrounded by smaller rocks. But in the hearth’s shallow pit archaeologists found 28 pounds of slag—a byproduct of iron roasting, the step in the ironworking process before smelting and forging. The smith burns and dries the ore in the fire so it doesn’t explode in the forge. After the break we talk about Edward Leedskalnin and his Coral Castle in Florida. Edward Leedskalnin, an immigrant to the United States of America, devised a means to single-handedly lift and maneuver blocks of coral weighing up to 30 tons each. In Homestead, Florida, using his closely guarded secret, he was able to quarry and construct an entire complex of monolithic blocks of coral in an arrangement that reflected his own unique character. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how according to police, a large disc-shaped UFO was stolen from the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico Saturday morning. After missing for several days, it was then found broken into pieces in a ditch on the side of a highway 2 miles outside of town. Although the theft was caught on a surveillance camera, the perpetrators of the crime are still at large. Then, Aaron Rodgers who is the quarterback of the Green Bay Packers had a Close Encounter of the First Kind. Then, a digital design student in New Jersey went viral over the weekend after 3D-printing his very own set of clear, orthodontic aligners - just like the ones that sell for thousands of dollars - all for less than US$60. Then, an Australian Radio hosts spots an unusual canid hybrid. After the break the guys discuss the history of Dogman/Upright walking canines. How long have they been amongst us and has their overall appearance changed over time. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about a possible time slip story. A woman named Debra in Dallas called in to Coast to Coast Am to tell of something that happened to her when she was a young girl. Then, taxi drivers working in towns in north-east Japan that were devastated in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami are reporting picking up "ghost passengers". Next, new research presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society demonstrated how to turn waste tomatoes into watts tomatoes, using a chemical reaction to generate electricity. Then, Mamdouh Eldamaty, the Egyptian antiquities minister, held a press conference in Cairo to announce a tantalizing new piece of evidence:  Radar scans on those walls have revealed not only the presence of hidden chambers, but also unidentified objects that lie within these rooms. These objects, Eldamaty said, seem to be composed of both metal and organic materials. After the break Kyle brings of the unusual Stone Spheres of Costa Rica and Cam talks about the Olmecs and their mysterious culture. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk with Mike Campbell about his new book "Amelia Earhart: The Truth at Last" the second edition. Nearly everything the American public has seen, read and heard in the media for nearly 80 years about the so-called Amelia Earhart mystery is intentionally false or inadvertently misleading. The widely accepted myth that the disappearance of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan during their ill-fated world-flight attempt in July 1937 is among the greatest aviation mysteries of the 20th century is an abject lie, the result of decades of government propaganda that continues unabated to this day. Amelia Earhart: The Truth at Last dismantles and debunks the popular theories that Amelia Earhart’s Electra crashed and sank off Howland Island on July 2, 1937, or landed at Gardner Island, now Nikumaroro, where the suddenly helpless fliers died of starvation on an island teeming with food sources. The Truth at Last presents many remarkable and enlightening new findings, eyewitness accounts, and never published revelations from unimpeachable sources including three famed U.S. flag officers and iconic newsman and Earhart researcher Fred Goerner’s files that reveal the truth about Amelia’s death on Saipan, as well as the sacred cow status of this matter within the U.S. Mike Campbell served as an award winning print and broadcast journalist while on active duty with the U.S. Navy and as a civilian public affairs officer with the Air Force. As a result of an assignment to write a newspaper overview story about the so-called Earhart “mystery” for the Navy, Mike began seriously studying the history of research into the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. In 1988 he began a long–term correspondence with Thomas E. Devine, author of the 1987 classic, <em>Eyewitness: The Amelia Earhart Incident</em>, and soon became convinced that Devine, Fred Goerner, Paul Briand Jr., Vincent V. Loomis and Bill Prymak were correct when they claimed that Earhart and Fred Noonan died on Saipan at an undetermined date after they failed to reach Howland Island on July 2, 1937. After 14 years of collaboration with Devine, <em>With Our Own Eyes: Eyewitnesses to the Final Days of Amelia Earhart</em>, was published in 2002 by a small Ohio company. He retired in October 2008 after 30 years of combined military and civilian service, and lives in Jacksonville, Florida with his wife, Nee, and their cats.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off by talking about how the loss of Louisiana’s coast due to saltwater intrusion, sea level rise and industry is a big problem for the environment and the economy. But it could also change our understanding of the state’s history. In some places, the water is taking with it ancient Native American sites, posing challenges for archaeologists. Then, A UFO investigator looking for evidence of flying saucers inadvertently stumbled across the suspected aircraft in an eight-month-old Google satellite image. If Scott C Waring is correct, the plane had travelled to the Cape of Good Hope, off Cape Town, South Africa. His claim today coincides with the discovery of debris on the east coast of Africa in an area between Mozambique and Madagascar. Then, as scientists step up their search for other life in the universe, two astrophysicists are proposing a way to make sure we don't miss the signal if extraterrestrial observers try to contact us first. Then, scientists are trying to clone extinct Ice Age cave lions using DNA from 12,000 year old remains. After the break Cam brings up the interesting and unsolved mystery of Crop Circles. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start out talking about a mysterious incident from the 1969 Apollo 10 mission. Declassified in 2008, NASA tapes reveal the three-man crew heard weird "outer space type music"  while orbiting the dark side of the moon. For the entire hour, the astronauts discuss and describe the music, even debating whether to inform NASA command. Then, for decades, robot hand design has tended to favor function over form, drawing from the world of man-made machines rather than intricate biology. Zhe Xu and Emanuel Todorov, from the university’s Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, began by laser scanning the hand of an actual human skeleton and using the data to 3D-print artificial bones. Then living tissue will grow over the artificial bones. Next, the talk about how recently an anonymous witness claiming to have seen thousands of files relating to “UFO/ET” projects while working at the Naval Telecommunication Center at NAS Moffett field in the late 80s, says he is going public because his secrecy agreement has expired and he would like the government to disclose what they know on about UFOs and aliens. Then, a team from Endurance Exploration Group used a remotely operated vehicle—or ROV—to recover a glass bottle, a chamber pot fragment, and a piece of china that had been sitting on the seabed some 1,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean's surface for more than 150 years. It was confirmation that they had discovered the resting place of the SS Connaught, a 370-foot-long steamer that sank April 21, 1860, about 100 miles from Boston. Now, Endurance is formulating a plan to retrieve the Connaught's suspected bounty: millions of dollars in gold coins. After the break the boys get into two really interesting lost or hidden treasures. The Spider Rock Treasure and Forrest Fenn's Treasure.  The Spider Rock Treasure starts off by strange discovery of an unusual rock by a man named Stewart who was at the time working on the legendary “Spider Rock” Spanish gold burial in the cedar brakes country near the Salt Fork of the Brazos River in Stonewall County. The Spider Rock map was dug up by a group of treasure hunters in 1908. A blueprint was made of the “map” since the mysterious rock itself has become lost. Out of all the Spanish treasure tales in the North Texas area, the Spider Rock story is probably the most authentic because of the finding of the buried map, number of relics and ancient smelter sites. Many of the clues the map laid out have been discovered and some of the reputed treasure even found. Forrest Fenn's Treasure is something all together different. This is the tale of a modern day hidden treasure that was intentionally buried by the Millionaire. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the boys start off by talking about how according to Massachusetts-based Terrafugia, a full-size unmanned prototype is expected to be ready by 2018. The firm's concept car has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end. These motors allow the TF-X to move from a vertical to a horizontal position, and will be powered by a 300 horsepower engine. Thrust will be provided by a ducted fan, and the vehicle will have a cruising speed of 200 mph (322 km/h), along with a 500-mile (805 km) flight range. Terrafugia said its aim is to provide 'true door-to-door transportation,' with the vehicle capable of being parked in a home garage like an ordinary car. Then, they bring up how surprising research, revealed for the first time in an exhibition opening next week at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, exposes that many were buried in new and decorated coffins, patched together from pieces of older coffins; some made only a few generations earlier. Then, a fast-growing tumbleweed dubbed "hairy panic" has taken over a street in a rural Australian town with homes and gardens clogged with the weed. Residents in Wangaratta, Victoria, have complained they have had to spent hours clearing away the weed only for it to come back the next day. Extremely dry conditions and winds mean that the weed, with a Latin name of Panicum effusum, is engulfing homes sometimes up to roof height. Then, Kyle brings up a new article posted by Gregg Newkirk on his blog the Week in Weird, about the interesting real life story of  Emily Isabella Burt, Georgia's real life Werewolf. After the break, the guys get into one of the most bizarre stories of all time, simply known as Mel's Hole. In 1997, Art Bell, of "Coast to Coast AM," the popular syndicated late night radio talk show, received a fax from a man named Mel Waters. The fax explained that Mel had what appeared to be a bottomless pit on his property near Manastash, Washington. Soon thereafter, Art booked Mel on his radio show, where Mel explained what would become known as "Mel's Hole" to the world. Mel was interviewed over the phone, and at the time of the interview he was not at home, but in the town of Ellensburg, WA. Mel had bought this property a few years earlier, and the previous owners had owned the land for over thirty years prior to that. The neighbors knew of the hole quite well, and would regularly dump their garbage in it, but the hole would never fill. It was a round pit, with a stone retaining wall surrounding it, and extending down, about 15 feet below the ground surface. Beyond the wall, the hole bore through dirt and bedrock, and from there, darkness as far as the eye could see. Mel had never met anybody who could remember when the hole was not there. The stories only grew into one of the most incredible stories ever told. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a great week!!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about a new documentary on Netflix called "The Nightmare". Then, how birds of prey might actually be spreading wild fires. Witnesses in Australia have seen black kites and brown falcons carrying burning twigs to dry areas, then dropping them, spreading wildfires in the Australian bush. Then, researchers at the University of Zurich and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland have developed software enabling drones to autonomously detect and follow forest paths. With the new drones, missing persons can be found and rescued quickly in forests and mountain areas. Then, a small group of scientists and conservationists believe they have recreated the quagga, which is distinct from other zebra mainly through the lack of the characteristic black and white stripes on its hindquarters. Over a period of 30 years the Quagga Project has used selective breeding of plains zebra to produce, in the fifth generation, an animal they say is indistinguishable from those that roamed the same plains centuries ago. Then after the first break the boys get into the unusual world of legends and folklore, in particular the Changeling. It is typically described as being the offspring of a fairy, elf or other legendary creatures that has been secretly left in the place of a human child. Sometimes the term is also used to refer to the child who was taken. The apparent changeling could also be a stock or fetch, an enchanted piece of wood that would soon appear to grow sick and die. The theme of the swapped child is common among medieval literature and reflects concern over infants thought to be afflicted with unexplained diseases, disorders, or developmental disabilities. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Kyle and Cam start off by talking about how Iceland is going to build the first temple to Norse gods in 1,000 years. Worship of the gods in Scandinavia gave way to Christianity around 1,000 years ago but a modern version of Norse paganism has been gaining popularity in Iceland. Then a hidden population of up to 200 lions found in remote Ethiopia. In the savannah of Alatash National Park, which is a remote part of north-west Ethiopia was considered a possible habitat for lions, but it is seldom visited by people. Now an expedition by the University of Oxford’s Conservation Research Unit has discovered that lions are indeed alive and well in the park – a rare extension of their known range. Then, you can now send a "message in a bottle" that will reach the north star in 434 years. A new project will beam people's text-based messages into space at light speed later this year, with the communications predicted to reach Polaris - or the North Star. The messages will be transmitted as radio signals, and the researchers hope they'll form something of a 'time capsule' that will reveal insights into how we feel about the environment at this crucial point in our history. Then, Woolly mammoth was never served at a lavish 1950s New York dinner where rare and extinct species were trumpeted as being on the menu, a researcher has said after putting leftover meat through DNA analysis. The Explorers Club soiree became folklore after it was said to have included 250,000-year-old extinct mammoth. Meat from a giant ground sloth was also promised. Then, sadly the great Dr. Edgar Mitchell passed away this last week. Mitchell was a member of Apollo 14 and the sixth man to ever walk on the Moon. After the break the guys talk to friends of the show David Flora and Dave Stecco of the Blurry Photos Podcast. Blurry Photos is a fantastic show that is the perfect combination of both comedy and the unknown, Blurry Photos is a podcast that aims to humorously shed light on the more shadowy topics the world has to offer. From cryptozoology and the paranormal to conspiracy theories and the unexplained, Blurry Photos will help educate and entertain you in a decently informational and whimsical way. Finally, Cam brings up another sasquatch sighting from Northern Ireland. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives, have a fantastic week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the boys start off by talking about how researchers have long known that eye contact is an important social signal. Our recognition of its import may even be hardwired. One study found that five-day-old babies prefer looking at faces that make direct eye contact compared with faces that have an averted gaze. Then, they bring up a recent Black Eyed Kid encounter by a hunter, Then, archaeologists working in southern Nevada have found nearly 20 sites used by ancient hunter-gatherers as much as 12,000 years ago. And even though the sites are remote, they weren’t discovered by accident. Scientists expected to find them there. About 160 kilometers [100 miles] northeast of Las Vegas, researchers from the Utah-based firm Logan Simpson discovered 19 separate sites containing a variety of stone points, biface blades, and other artifacts associated with the Paleoarchaic Period, an era ranging from 7,000 to 12,000 years ago. Then, after the break the guys talk about the history of submarines and a haunted or cursed vessel called UB-65 and some true tales of haunted cruise ships!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how after a botched repair job of the famed pharaoh’s beard left scratches on his burial mask, Egyptian prosecutors have ordered eight museum workers to a disciplinary court for “gross negligence.” Then, the solar system appears to have a new ninth planet. Recently, two scientists announced evidence that a body nearly the size of Neptune—but as yet unseen—orbits the sun every 15,000 years. During the solar system’s infancy 4.5 billion years ago, they say, the giant planet was knocked out of the planet-forming region near the sun. Slowed down by gas, the planet settled into a distant elliptical orbit, where it still lurks today. Then, Cam talks about how two people claim they saw an ape-like creature in a small wooded area of Northern Ireland. Then after the break, Kyle and Cam bring up some interesting Listener Stories that were graciously sent to Expanded Perspectives. Thanks for listening!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Cam and Kyle start the show off by bringing up how surgeons used a new technique to attach a thought-controlled robot arm directly to an amputee’s stump, giving him a far greater range of motion with the advanced prosthetic limb. The system, involving an implant inserted into the bone at the end of the residual limb, allows test patient Johnny Matheny to use the arm without the constraining and sometimes uncomfortable harness he previously used when experimenting with the Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL). Then, some stone tools found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi predate the arrival of modern humans to the area by more than 60,000 years—but researchers aren’t sure who made them. The perplexing artifacts, announced in <em>Nature</em> magazine, are most likely between 118,000 and 194,000 years old, though some may be even older. The keen-edged flakes of stone were excavated from an ancient river floodplain in southwest Sulawesi, near the present-day village of Talepu. Some even bear telltale signs of being hammered into shape. Then, the latest numbers on American orange production are out from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the news is not good. Since 2012, more than a third of all American oranges have died out—and the numbers get even grimmer if you look at just Florida, which has lost about half its crop in that time. Then, the 40th Anniversary of the scariest documented encounter with Texas’ Big Bird! just occurred this last week. It occurred just north of Raymondville in Willacy County one evening on January 14th, 1976. Then after the break the boys get into some strange encounters in the woods. Finally, artist George Coghill launches his fifth Kickstarter campaign, "Ghost Guard" on January 25, 2016. The campaign is raising funds to help manufacture his artist merchandise set which will feature embroidered patches, an enamel lapel pin and a screen-printed identification card. All items will include glow-in-the-dark features. Check it Out! Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives! Please write and rate the show for us on iTunes.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how a Chinese drone maker Ehang Inc. recently  unveiled what it calls the world's first drone capable of carrying a human passenger. The Guangzhou, China-based company pulled the cloth off the Ehang 184 at the Las Vegas Convention Center during the CES gadget show. In a company video showing it flying, it looks like a small helicopter but with four doubled propellers spinning parallel to the ground like other drones. Then they discuss how a man in North Carolina says he recently encountered a being that resembled a “Neanderthal”. Then they discuss how Tesla’s cars now drive themselves, kinda. After the break, Cam and Kyle talk about the Georgia Guidestones and America's Stonehenge. The Georgia Guidestones is a granite monument erected in 1980 in Elbert County, Georgia, in the United States. A set of 10 guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages, and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts. The monument stands at the highest point in Elbert County, about 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, and 9 miles (14 km) north of the center of Elberton. The stones are visible from Georgia Highway 77 (Hartwell Highway) and are reached by turning east on Guidestones Road. America's Stonehenge is an archaeological site consisting of a number of large rocks and stone structures scattered around roughly 30 acres (120,000 m2) within the town of Salem, New Hampshire in the northeast United States. America's Stonehenge is open to the public for a fee. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about a giant squid, rarely seen outside of deep waters, has been filmed swimming near a pier in central Japan. The 3.7-metre-long squid was spotted swimming under fishing boats at Toyama Bay on Christmas Eve. Next, the Great Barrier Reef will have a robotic protector beginning this winter. The underwater autonomous vehicle is programmed to patrol the massive living structure in search of destructive crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), which it then kills by lethal injection. Then, they talk about how a 10-year-old child reportedly saw a dinosaur-like bird in New Mirpur City. Finally, they bring up how small-scale Mexican marijuana farmers say the loosening of marijuana laws across the U.S. has increased competition from growers north of the border and could put them out of business. After the break Kyle presents the interesting possible UFO case know as "The Battle of Los Angeles". Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this last episode of 2015 the guys bring up the top ten builds by the Ancients that were exposed during this year. There is no doubt that our ancient ancestors were adept at creating beautiful and masterful structures. The features they managed to construct easily rival some of the most important works built today. Stone circles, architectural structures, petroglyphs, geoglyphs, and fortresses are some of the more elaborate builds that made the news in 2015. Then after the break Cam brings up the interesting case of the Ararat Anomaly. The anomaly is located on the northwest corner of the Western Plateau of Mount Ararat at about 15,500 ft (4,724 m), some 2.2 km (1.4 mi) west of the 16,854 ft (5,137 m) summit, on the edge of what appears from the photographs to be a steep downward slope. On this slope it appears to have a very large man-made object possibly a large ship or UFO buried within the ice. Is this truly Noah's Ark? Or is it an unknown crashed UFO? After the final break the guys get into a brand new global coffee production report that is out from the Foreign Agricultural Service with some seemingly confusing news: Brazil, the world’s foremost coffee supplier, lost almost five million bags of coffee due to the country’s punishing, on-going drought. Yet at the same time, globally coffee production is just slightly up and looking to stay up through the upcoming season. What’s going on here? Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Have a Happy New Year!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how Art Bell is going to retire once again. For the last several weeks 70-year-old radio legend Art Bell has been shot at, twice, by some crazy person who’s bound and determined to force Bell to stop doing his show. The last incident was just a few days ago; Bell was on his way to his studio when shots rang out. Bell was forced to lie in the dirt on his belly until the police showed up. It's sad to see a radio legend like Art having to give up on his dreams. It was a pleasure for both Kyle and Cam to be re-broadcast on the same network as Art. He will be missed. Next, Kyle brings up an interesting UFO sighting in Longmont, Colorado where a 2-year-old boy pointed to a UFO hovering under 500 feet saying, “Look, Daddy.” The reporting witness was out walking with his son about 8:30 p.m. on March 21, 2015, when the object was first seen. Then Cam talks about a team of eight engineering students from the National University of Singapore have built a personal flying machine, dubbed "Snowstorm". It could only be demonstrated by flying it indoors, due to Singapore's legal requirements for personal aerial vehicles. Resembling a giant drone, "Snowstorm" comprises of motors, propellers and landing gears set within a hexagonal frame and can be controlled by the person sitting in it, or remotely. Then Kyle brings up his new love of the Tesla Model S. Unlike a gasoline internal combustion engine with hundreds of moving parts, Tesla electric motors have only one moving piece: the rotor. As a result, Model S acceleration is instantaneous, silent and smooth. Step on the accelerator and in as little as 2.8 seconds Model S is travelling 60 miles per hour, without hesitation, and without a drop of gasoline. Model S is an evolution in automobile engineering. After the break Cam introduces some very strange close encounters with extraterrestrials far different than our normal ideas of what an Alien should look like. Finally, in the last portion of the show Kyle talks about how a filmmaker has released transcripts from his upcoming documentary about Stanley Kubrick recorded just a few days before Kubrick’s death which imply that Stanley admitted filming a fake moon landing and forced his fellow filmmaker to keep the admission hidden from the public for 15 years. The 15 years are up … is the truth about the moon landing up too? Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Please write and rate the show on iTunes and tell your friends.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about a recent Texas witness at Hutto who reported watching a sphere shaped UFO near ground level emitting a green light that appeared to be searching for something, then how scientist's still don't know what causes that knuckle cracking sound. After the break Cam gets into the unusual Alaska legend of the Kushtaka or Otterman! The Tlingit and Tsimshian peoples, indigenous inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest Coast of the United States and Southeastern Alaska, have a robust folklore surrounding a mythical and maniacal trickster race called the Kushtaka, which roughly translates as “land otter people”, a shape-shifting species of otter that is rumored to spend a lot of its time trying to lure unsuspecting humans away from their homes in order to turn them into more Kushtaka. Finally, after the second break Kyle brings up the latest information regarding a missing Nazi Ghost Train found in Poland. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about 15 astounding technologies that DARPA is currently working on right now. DARPA has had a hand in major inventions like GPS, the internet, and stealth aircraft. And it's always developing new technologies for military or intelligence-related systems that could end up having a huge impact outside the battlefield as well. Then they discuss how American asteroid mining is now fully legal. No one has managed to pluck valuable minerals from an asteroid quite yet, but when they do, the legal framework will be firmly in place: earlier this week, President Obama signed the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA) into law. Then After the break Cam talks about the mysterious monoliths of Asuka Nara Japan known as "Masuda No Iwafune."  After that Kyle brings up some very interesting Reptilian encounters.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about a scholar of early Christianity at the University of Texas has announced his discovery earlier this year of a priceless fragment of the New Testament written in ancient Greek – for sale on eBay with an opening bid of just $99, next they discuss how giant waves have recently exposed rare petroglyphs that have not been seen in years. Then after the break we get into some strange sightings/encounters that seem to happen around bridges. It's almost like bridges themselves are some kind or portal, some kind of bridge or doorway through which a collective multitude of paranormal phenomena is entering our realm of existence. Finally, we play an amazing encounter one of our listeners had in Alaska with the "Kushtaka." Thanks for listening, have a great week!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how prehistoric farmers were perhaps the very first beekeepers and how traces of beeswax have been found on ancient pottery from Europe, the Near East and North Africa.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about about how a man built his own homemade Railgun, then they talk about how the Government takes the family land of the Sheahan's near Area 51. Then Cam brings up a boy in Indiana has an Alien Abduction where he claims that he saw other beings being housed inside pods. Then after the break the guys talk about the Mysterious Djinn. In Western lore djinn are sometimes equated with demons, but they are not the same. They are often portrayed as having a demonic-like appearance, but they can also appear in beautiful, seductive forms. The djinn are masterful shape-shifters, and their favored forms are snakes and black dogs. They also can masquerade as anything: humans, animals, ghosts, cryptids, and other entities such as extraterrestrials, demons, shadow people, fairies, angels and more. The djinn are not confined to the Middle East, or to the past. They exist in their own realm, probably a parallel dimension, and they have the ability – and the desire – to enter our world and interact with us. The djinn have been among us in antiquity and they are among us now. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives!

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys discuss how a Michigan farmer uncovers a rare, nearly complete Woolly Mammoth fossil in his field, a woman in Kentucky spots a pink 'Pig-Human Hybrid' running across the road, a man in Oswego County, New York records what he believes are Sasquatch/Bigfoot howling sounds, then they discuss how a warming world could be a Crocodile infested one. Then after the break Cam brings up some unusual flying humanoid sightings both in America and even Poland and Kyle brings up friend of the show Lon Strickler's sighting of the Sykesville Monster in Maryland.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how all across the world Bears are beginning to rise up against humans, two people encounter "Monster" at Lake Champlain, the after the break the guys discuss "The Third Man Factor". The Third Man factor or Third Man Effect refers to the reported situations where an unseen presence such as a "spirit" provides comfort or support during traumatic experiences. Sir Ernest Shackleton in his book <em>South</em>, described his belief that an incorporeal being joined him and two others during the final leg of their journey. Shackleton wrote, "during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to me often that we were four, not three."His admission resulted in other survivors of extreme hardship coming forward and sharing similar experiences. In recent years well-known adventurers like climber Reinhold Messner and polar explorers Peter Hillary and Ann Bancroft have reported the experience. One study of cases involving adventurers reported that the largest group involved climbers, with solo sailors and shipwreck survivors being the second most common group, followed by polar explorers. Thanks for listening to Expanded Perspectives. Don't forget to write us review on iTunes and if you want more, there is always Expanded Perspectives Elite!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about how we should not dismiss the dangers of killer robots so quickly and a real life Red Sonja has been discovered in Kazakhstan. Then after the break Cam and Kyle talk about the Newport Tower. Who could of built it and does it have Masonic ties? Also called the Old Stone Tower, Touro Tower, Old Stone Mill or, simply, The Tower, standing near the west end of Touro Park in Newport, Rhode Island, the round stone structure and its park owe their existence to the generosity of Judah Touro, who in 1854 gave the City of Newport $10,000 to buy the land so that it would not be developed into home sites. Founded in 1639, the town of Newport had grown up the hill from Narragansett Bay and Newport Harbor to engulf the meadows that lay above the shore.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this weeks episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys have on to discuss his new book Mr. Scott Creighton. His new book "The Secret Chamber of Osiris - Lost Knowledge of the Sixteen Pyramids" is an amazing look at how a growing body of evidence suggests the first 16 pyramids of ancient Egypt were not royal tombs but nearly indestructible recovery vaults designed to revive civilization after an anticipated major catastrophe, the Deluge of Thoth. Scott Creighton examines the prophecy of catastrophe and the ancient Egyptians' massive undertaking to ensure the survival of their civilization. He explains how the pyramids acted as easily located storehouses for seeds, tools, andcivilizing knowledge, het they would have been too visible to house the precious treasures necessary to restore the rich culture of ancient Egypt. For this, the ancients created a secret chamber whose existence was hidden in myth and whose location was encoded in the Giza pyramids. Creighton shows how, collectively, the first 16 pyramids represent the allegorical "dismembered body of Osiris," the Egyptian god of agriculture and rebirth, and, as in the myth of Osiris, one part is missing for hidden-a secret chamber under the sands of the Giza plateau. Creighton reveals how the 3 great pyramids of Giza "point' to the secret location and how they were built with technology akin to modern hot air balloons that was used to "fly the stones into place" as cited in Egyptian legends and shown in ancient art. Offering a new understanding of this remarkable civilization, the author concludes with a startling revelation: shortly after he revealed the location of the secret chamber of Osiris-a location never before explored-it became the site of a major excavation by the Egyptian authorities, the results of which have yet to be made public.  Scott Creighton is an engineer whose extensive travels have allowed him to explore many of the world's ancient sacred sites. The host of the Alternative Egyptology forum on <a href="http://AboveTopSecret.com">AboveTopSecret.com</a>, he is the coauthor of The Giza Prophecy and lives in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about using their new App Periscope, how construction of the world’s largest telescope is being built in Chile and now drones can be controlled by your smartphone. After the break the guys talk about the new Bridgewater Triangle documentary and some strange encounters from that area. In 1983, Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman published his book, <em>Mysterious America</em>. In it, he described a 200 square-mile area in Southeastern Massachusetts with a long history of strange, paranormal, and sometimes, sinister activity. He called the region “The Bridgewater Triangle”. The triangle includes a number of locations known for unexplained occurrences; the most prominent of which include the legendary Hockomock Swamp and the infamous Freetown-Fall River State Forest.  The triangle’s traditional borders are revealed by connecting the dots between the town of Abington to the North, the town of Freetown to the Southeast, and the town of Rehoboth to the Southwest. The area hosts an unusually high volume of reports involving strange happenings, baffling mysteries and sinister deeds.  From ghostly hauntings and cryptid animal sightings, to UFO encounters and evidence of satanic ritual sacrifice, the Bridgewater Triangle serves as one of the world’s most diverse hotspots for paranormal activity. The first-ever feature-length documentary on the subject, <em>The Bridgewater Triangle</em> explores the history of this fascinating region.  The film features a number of local residents providing first-hand accounts of unexplained occurrences.  In addition, an all-star assembly of paranormal researchers, folklorists and authors provide expert analysis regarding the many mysteries of the triangle.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk with the legendary Red Pill Junkie and the infamous Micah Hanks about the unveiling of the mysterious Roswell Slides. If you are unfamiliar with the Roswell Slides, a team of UFO researchers announced at a livestreamed online press conference on Feb. 4 that it has obtained Kodachrome slide images that provide “smoking gun” evidence that aliens are real and that an alien UFO crash actually occurred in Roswell in 1947, despite government denial. According to Anthony Bragalia, He said the images on the slides have been examined and declared authentic by a photo specialist who had worked with Kodak for decades and had led technical project teams at the company’s headquarters in Rochester, New York, and published authoritative books in the field. After conducting detailed and extensive tests on the slides, the specialist concluded that they were authentic slides from 1947 that had not been “tampered with or manipulated in any way”. The images were revealed on May 4th to a large crowd in Mexico City, Mexico. The images depict what looks like a mummified child in a glass display case. We talk about the actual photographs and discuss what the photograph most likely is. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk with Betty Andreasson and Bob Luca. Betty Andreasson was born Betty Aho in January 07, 1937 to parents Waino and Eva Aho. Betty attended school in Westminster and Gardner MA. As a youngster Betty was always interested in art and became a talented self taught artist in adulthood. She married her first husband James Andreasson in 1954 and they went on to have seven children. Ultimately there were problems in the marriage and after a long separation they divorced in 1977. Later in 1977 Betty met her husband Bob Luca and they were married in 1978. Betty is well known for her UFO experiences which have been written about in five books by author Raymond E. Fowler.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Betty has been featured on numerous TV and Radio shows as well as newspaper and magazine articles. She has traveled the Country lecturing about her experiences and has found that meeting so many people from all over the Country, many which had experienced the UFO phenomena in one form or another as well, was in itself a rewarding experience. For a number of years Betty and Bob were unsettled and changed residences several times while living in CT and finally moving to VA in 1995. After living in VA for approximately five years they moved to West Palm Beach FL. where they enjoyed the warm winters and total lack of snow. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bob Luca was born on March 27, 1939 in Meriden, CT to parents Anthony and Anne Luca. Bob attended grade school and high school in Meriden and graduated in 1957. His main interests while growing up were always how mechanical and electrical things worked. Post high school, Bob worked as a mechanic. He met Betty and they married in 1978 in Meriden, CT. Bob and Betty have both had abduction experiences separately and together as well. </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives Kyle and Cam speak about how soldiers could have their bones copied and 3D printed in case of injury,  how they are planning on using drones to scan for ancient Amazonia, a new cache of medieval Arab gold coins may already be the largest in the eastern Mediterranean, and there's probably more to come, a CT scan reveals that statue of the Buddha is actually a mummy. Then during the interview portion of the show the guys speak with Carl Lehrburger about his new book 'Secrets of Ancient America'. Carl Lehrburger is an environmental activist, renewable energy entrepreneur, researcher and author. He is a founder and an executive manager of PureVision Technology, Inc. Since founding PureVision in 1992, PureVision scientists have developed a unique and green conversion technology to transform non-food plants (known as biomass) including wood and agricultural residues such as corn cobs and leaves into a myriad of bio products.  PureVision is pioneering the renewable economy. Bear &amp; Co. has published his first book, <em>Secrets of Ancient America</em>, which is the culmination of over 25 years of Carls investigations of archaeological and sacred sites, with a focus on Old World peoples in the Americas before Columbus.  His research of the ancients in the New World includes the Celts, Phoenicians, Romans, Hebrews, Indus Valley and Asian peoples in the Americas. More than a history book, <em>Secrets of Ancient America </em>is a first hand account of how Carl learned to see a New History.  <em>Secrets of Ancient America</em> also addresses the fundamental question, 'why has the evidence been ignored and Americans remain ignorant of their history?' and presents a new historical paradigm. (See his New History website at<a href="http://newhistoryofamerica.net/"> www.NewHistoryOfAmerica.net </a>for additional information on the book and his work.)</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys discuss the new CEO of the Discovery Channel says no more Man Eating Snakes and Fake Sharks, Multiple low flying triangle UFOs reported over North Carolina and Did Humans Walk the Earth with Dinosaurs? Triceratops Horn Dated to 33,500 Years. Then during the interview portion of show the guys talk with author and researcher J. Nathan Couch. J. Nathan Couch grew up in the foothills of Northeast Georgia’s Appalachian Mountains. Given the area’s rich tradition of ghost stories and folklore, it’s no wonder he developed a passion for the bizarre and the unexplained. Nathan is currently a resident of West Bend, Wisconsin and is owner and tour guide of the Downtown West Bend Ghost Walks. His first book <em>Washington County Paranormal: A Wisconsin Legend Trip</em> was published in 2012, and his fictional short story <em>Anna</em> appeared in the 2013 WWA Press anthology <em>A Wisconsin Harvest Volume II</em>. He’s also written articles and columns for <a href="http://FilmFanatix.com">FilmFanatix.com</a>, <a href="http://WisconsinSickness.com">WisconsinSickness.com</a>, and <a href="http://CultOfWeird.com">CultOfWeird.com</a> to name only a few. When he isn’t writing about ghosts and monsters he’s usually talking about them with Mike Hoke on <em>The Strange Side with Mike and Nate</em>, a weekly Internet radio show that airs live each week on <a href="http://ZTalkRadio.com">ZTalkRadio.com</a>, or chasing ghosts with the Paranormal Investigation and Research Society.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys talk about Does Bigfoot Really Braid Horse's Hair, Why Eel Drones Are the Future of Naval Warfare, Exorcists Warn Against buying Ouija Boards as Gifts. Then during the interview portion of the show the guys talk with David Roundtree and Robbie Lunt about they're new book "Demon Street, USA".</p>

<p> </p>

<p>David Roundtree began his research into the paranormal professionally in 1976, and has investigated cases scientifically from Rhode Island to Key West, Florida. David has experimented with both scientific as well as metaphysical techniques in his study of unexplained occurrences. Over the course of his research he was able to confirm EVP was not related to sound by the use of a Bell Jar, a vacuum pump, a Shure dynamic microphone and a TEAC A-4010S Reel to Reel recorder. Due to several encounters of a very negative nature from 1985-87, he made the decision to concentrate on the scientific research concerning the phenomena, and not the metaphysical aspects of the events. In 1992 David formed a new organization, Scientific Paranormal Investigative Research Information and Technology (S.P.I.R.I.T.), and began a long and painstaking process of collecting, building and focusing a battery of hi-tech instrumentation to concentrate on laboratory and field experimentation to search for the cause of paranormal phenomena. By 1998 his focus of research had narrowed to phenomena specific to “Hauntings”. His primary focus since 1998 has been EVP research, employing his background of audio engineering and psychoacoustics. In 2005 David successfully linked electromagnetic fields as the primary source of EVPs. In 2010 he discovered that paranormal related EMF was an emergent phenomenon. He continues to look for answers in science for paranormal phenomena.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Robbie Lunt was born in an army hospital in Augsburg, West Germany in the middle of the Cold War. His father was an intelligence officer, the true warriors in the day-to-day battles of the conflict. Moving between Germany and the metro DC area fairly regularly in his childhood gave him a very broad cultural awareness. Sensitive since a young age, his interest in the paranormal was never stymied, in fact, it was subtly encouraged. Two of the earliest books he received from his grandparents were “The Return of the Greyman and Georgetown Ghosts” and “This Haunted Land: Where Ghosts Still Roam.” At the tender age of 7, he was introduced to the fascinating world of martial arts. It was at that point he was first trained in meditation and the concept of chi. He has tried to be diligent with the practices over the years. While he was growing up Robbie always wanted to live in a haunted house. He finally got his wish, tenfold. He also found out that there can be much more to hauntings; things that go bump in the night sometimes can hurt you. Experiences with very negative entities set Robbie on the shamanic path.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>John Anthony West (born January 1, 1932 in New York) is an American author, lecturer, guide and a proponent of Sphinx water erosion hypothesis in geology. Influenced by R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, in 1993 his work with Robert M. Schoch, a geologist and associate professor of natural science at the College of General Studies at Boston University was presented by Charlton Heston in a NBC special called "The Mystery of the Sphinx" that won West an News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award for Best Research and a nomination for Best Documentary. The documentary contends that the main type of weathering evident on the  Great Sphinx and surrounding enclosure walls could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall during the time period from 10,000 to 5000 BCE and was carved out of limestone bedrock by an ancient advanced culture. This challenged the conventional dating of the carving of the statue circa 2500 BCE. West suggested that the Sphinx may be over twice as old as originally determined, whereas Schoch made a more conservative determination of between 5000 and 7000 BCE</p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode of Expanded Perspectives we discuss the how Developers and Preservationists Find Historic Common Ground in Miami, New Bigfoot recordings from Washington, Chupacabra sightings from the early 19th century. After the break we talk with Christopher O'Brien about his new book "Stalking the Herd". </p>

<p>Since 1992, Christopher O'Brien has investigated over one thousand paranormal events reported in the San Luis Valley--located in South-central Colorado/North Central New Mexico. Working with law enforcement officials, ex-military, ranchers and an extensive network of skywatchers, from 1992 to 2002 he documented one of the most intense waves of unexplained activity ever reported from a single geographic region of North America. His ten-year investigation resulted in the three books of his "mysterious valley" trilogy, The Mysterious Valley, Enter the Valley, and Secrets of the Mysterious Valley. His meticulous field investigation of UFO reports, unexplained livestock deaths, Native American legends, cryptozoology, secret military activity and the folklore, found in the world's largest alpine valley, has produced one of the largest databases of unusual occurrences gathered from a single geographic region. He is currently working with a team of specialists installing a high-tech video surveillance and hard-data monitoring system in and around the San Luis Valley. His latest book Stalking the Herd is what we are discussing on todays show.</p>
