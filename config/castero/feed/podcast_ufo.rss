      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 1973, the claims of Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker that they’d been abducted by elephant-skinned, robot-like creatures in Pascagoula, Mississippi, opened researchers up to what have become known as “high-strangeness” reports. The term comes from J. Allen Hynek’s efforts at creating a system of strangeness ratings in Chapter Four of his 1975 book, The UFO Experience. Hickson and Parker were taken seriously because they seemed genuinely traumatized by their experience while just the two of them were waiting in a room at the police station where they first reported their encounter. They just been interviewed, and unbeknownst to them, a tape recorder in the room was left running, which captured the bewildered men talking to each other about their experience. Their story was reported in newspapers and UFO publications worldwide. After that, abduction reports began to increasingly appear. In the midst of this new openness to high-strangeness reports, in 1979, there was a story told by a trucker that was highly unique, and highly strange, and yet was still given serious consideration by the local newspapers and investigators who examined it. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/a-trucker-reports-a-harrowing-ufo-encounter/#more-4063" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Many readers may not be aware that, at one point in time, the National Enquirer was associated with serious UFO research in spite of its reputation as a sensationalistic supermarket tabloid. In 1972, the Enquirer put together what they called “The National Enquirer Blue Ribbon UFO Panel,” which was made up of five UFO researchers, all of whom held PhDs. The Enquirer was offering a $50,000 reward for proof, by the end of the year, that UFOs came from space and were not a natural phenomenon. The panel was tasked with evaluating UFO cases to determine if any of them provided such proof. The panel members included four consultants for the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a scientific consultant for the Air Force’s UFO investigation for most of its existence. All of them had good reputations within the UFO community, and the reader may wonder why they would put those at risk by being associated with the Enquirer in such an endeavor. It’s likely that the prospect of getting some of their research funded by the Enquirer may have helped them to put aside any aversions, and the assignment in 1975 of <a href="https://podcastufo.com/ufos-in-the-national-enquirer/" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Bob Pratt</a> to the Enquirer UFO desk, who became respected as an investigator in his own right, may have encouraged them to continue their association. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/the-national-enquirer-ufo-blue-ribbon-panel/#more-4043" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>1973 was a special year for UFO enthusiasts. Not only were there a huge number of reports in  newspapers as can be seen in the issues (https://files.afu.se/Downloads/?dir=Magazines%2FUnited%20States%2FUFO%20Newsclipping%20Service) of the UFO News Clipping Service from that year, there were many that were especially strange.

The case has endured in the UFO mythos despite the likelihood that the story was made up by a reporter trying to raise some publicity for a dying town.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to reporting UFO sightings, it often happens that local police departments are the first organizations witnesses turn to. Many times, the reports to police take place while the UFO is still active in the area and patrol officers are able to respond and verify witness accounts. Famous examples are the 1966 case involving Dale Spaur and his partner, Wilbur “Barney” Neff, who chased a UFO from Portage County, Ohio, all the way into Pennsylvania, and another Ohio case, this time in Trumbull County in 1994, involving multiple officers chasing and observing UFOs.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In last week’s blog, we introduced two people, Richard Doty, a self-professed Air Force Office of Special Investigations disinformation agent, and William Moore, a UFO researcher and co-author of the 1980 book The Roswell Incident, who had a profound influence on the UFO narrative in the 1980’s that culminated in a television presentation, UFO Cover-Up? Live!” What was discussed (scripted) on the show was the now familiar narrative of greys, crashed flying saucers, GOVERNMENT recovery of crash debris and alien bodies, and subsequent cover-up. Moore and Doty have since come forward as having been partners in what they claimed was a GOVERNMENT disinformation program targeting UFOlogists. We closed with the hypothesis that Doty was acting on his own and that Moore played along because he had a need to believe and stood to make some money from the “inside information” that Doty was feeding him and his fellow researchers.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If one was to pick a point when UFOlogy went off the rails, October 14, 1988, is one to consider. That was the date that a television show, UFO Cover-Up? Live!, aired on 130 syndicated channels throughout the United States. It was a flop, but an examination of the people who were involved in the production provides insight into how it came to be that a few dubious individuals left us with what have been convincingly argued are bogus stories and documents that support the idea that the GOVERNMENT has recovered crashed alien spaceships and bodies. A lasting belief is that this came about as the result of an organized GOVERNMENT disinformation program targeting the UFO community. A question this writer is examining is whether or not this too is bogus. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/behind-the-scenes-of-ufo-cover-up-live/#more-3818" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In July of 1967, Ronnie Hill, a 14-year-old North Carolina boy, reported that he’d taken a picture of a UFO with a humanoid in front of it. According to John Keel, who wrote about the story in his article, “The Little Man of North Carolina,” published in the January-February 1969 <a href="http://noufors.com/Documents/Books,%20Manuals%20and%20Published%20Papers/Specialty%20UFO%20Publications/Flying%20Saucer%20Review/FSR,1969,Jan-Feb,V%2015,N%201.pdf" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Flying Saucer Review</a>, the boy sent the picture off to Flying Saucers-UFO Reports, which had just been discontinued by its publisher, Dell Publishing. The editor, Carmena Freeman, sent the picture to Keel and he began a correspondence with Hill, which continued throughout 1968. According to Keel, Hill was “agonizingly slow” in responding to his letters. Keel wrote in his article that he had the photo blown up “to wall size” and that he and “several professional photographers” didn’t see anything that made it seem that the figure was a doll or some other form of hoax. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/a-photo-of-a-ufo-and-humanoid/#more-3718" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

Eisenhower was in Palm Springs, California, on what was described to the public as a “vacation.” On February 20, he disappeared from public view and rumors spread to the point that the headline, “Pres. Eisenhower died tonight of a heart attack in Palm Springs.,” appeared on the Associated Press newswire. The story was removed two minutes later and the AP reported that he was still alive.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>As far as classic UFO cases go, Ohio may very well have more than any other state. There was the 1966 case where Deputy Sheriff Dale Spaur and his partner chased a UFO from Portage County, Ohio, all the way into Pennsylvania at speeds up to 100 mph. In 1973, there was the Coyne Incident, where four men in the Army Reserve reported an encounter near Mansfield, Ohio, with a UFO that pulled their helicopter, commanded by Lawrence J. Coyne, up from 1,700 feet to 3,500 feet while the controls were set for a descent. In 1994, police in Trumbull County responded to a police dispatcher who said she’d received calls about a UFO from local citizens. Before the night was over, police from five different departments gave chase, and a recording of their radio exchanges with the dispatch was given to researcher Kenny Young, who brought the case to the attention of the UFO community and the world. A 1971 case from Huron County, Ohio, that had multiple witnesses, including police officers, didn’t gain nearly was much notoriety as those above, and one might wonder if it might have been because of the way it was treated by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. The main witness sent a report to NICAP, but NICAP was in the midst of changes that may or not have been overseen by either or both the Air Force and the CIA. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/an-ohio-ufo-case-that-was-left-to-die/#more-3388" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>UFOlogy in China is deeply interwoven with China’s politics. In 1978, China began what is known as “the reform,” which involved China opening up its economy to the West and the lifting of many restrictions. According to the <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2020/10/19/on-ufology-with-chinese-characteristics-and-the-fate-of-chinese-socialism/" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">article</a> by Malcolm Thompson, “On UFOlogy With Chinese Characteristics and the Fate of Chinese Socialism,” in the May-August 2020 edition of the online journal Made in China, “there was no public UFOlogy in China before the reform period, and Chinese UFOlogy and the reform period began at almost exactly the same time.” According to Thompson, the China UFO Enthusiasts Liaison Office was set up at Wuhan University on September 20, 1979. This became the China UFO Research Association by May 1980 and by the mid-1980s, there were over 40 branch organizations with thousands of members all over the country. As the reform developed and the state’s limits of tolerance were tested, the state approved approach to UFOlogy became science based and strictly non-paranormal. With this limitation in mind, UFOlogists are not only free to investigate but often do so with the government’s help. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/ufology-in-china/#more-3362" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>On January 1, 1970, the new year dawned in Canada with a UFO and occupants report. This was in the midst of a flap centered on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It was investigated by John Magor, editor and publisher of the Canadian UFO Report, and he provided a report to the Victoria Times. The Victoria Times published an article on the case on page 1 of the January 5, 1970 <a href="https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%20States/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service%20-%201970%2002%20-%20no%2010.pdf" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">edition</a> (page 10 of link), and Magor published his version in the Volume 1, Number 7, summer issue of the Canadian UFO Report.</p><p>News indicating there was an ongoing flap in the area turns up in the December 22, 1969 <a href="https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%20States/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service%20-%201970%2002%20-%20no%2010.pdf" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">edition</a> (page 8 of link) of the Victorian Times under the headline “Look Up Islanders, The UFOs Are Watching You.” A sighting by four witnesses in the Ladysmith area is described. Two of the witnesses, Graham Toole, 21, and Albert Birkeland, 22, reported they were driving when they saw an object with three lights, white on top and red on the bottom. Mr. and Mrs. Ray Knight reported seeing what the reporter for the times wrote “must be the same object.” According to the article, they agreed with Toole and Birkeland that it “moved about a mile a second.” Mr. Knight said that he had seen an object in September where “you could see the cabin lights clearly.” The article also describes a “greyish saucer-shaped object with a transparent center” seen by five people over an elementary school in Duncan. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/a-ufo-and-occupants-in-british-columbia-canada/#more-3339" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hoaxes have been a part of the flying saucer/UFO mystery from its very beginning. Shortly after Kenneth Arnold’s sighting report on June 24, 1947, people started coming forward with physical disks they claimed to have found in their yards, in fields, or to have actually seen flying through the air in flames and then crash. Claimants ranged from school children to professional adults, and there is even a report from a Catholic priest that received a good deal of press. The priest’s case, as well as others of this sort ended up in FBI files. The disks that were displayed were obviously home made, sometimes quite crudely, but there was the possibility that these could be responsible for valid sightings reports by people who were truly mystified. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/when-ufos-were-flying-disks/#more-3146" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>While 1954 in America was mostly about the saucers, that year in France was more about the occupants, also known as “humanoids.” It was then that French researcher Aimé Michel came to international prominence as he investigated, collected data, and tried to unravel the mystery. A young Jaques Vallée first became interested in flying saucers at this time. He was later inspired by Michel’s work and went on to achieve prominence as a respected and influential figure in the field.</p><p>On September 10, 1954, 34-year-old Quarouble resident Marius Dewilde reported an incident to the local police that received extensive press coverage, not only in France, but worldwide. According to Dewilde, at 10:30 p.m. he was sitting in his house, located next to some railroad tracks, when his dog, Kiki, started barking outside. Equipped with a flashlight, he went to investigate.</p><p>Outside, he noticed a large object, which he assumed was a harvest cart, six meters from his front door. He then saw two figures on a nearby path that was often used by smugglers. He pointed his flashlight at them, and there was a reflection on what seemed to be a glass helmet with a head inside. He only got a quick look, but the head seemed especially large.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Capturing a UFO in a photo or video is the goal of many UFO enthusiasts, but wouldn’t it be great to physically capture a UFO and examine it? From Japan comes the story of a group of young boys who claimed to have done just that. According to them, it was a small hat-shaped object that eventually managed to escape from them, but not before they were able to make some detailed drawings of it. The story made international news and is still discussed today. Japanese researcher, Otakupapa, wrote a well-researched six-part <a href="https://otakupapa.net/en/kera-incident-1/" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">series</a> about the case titled, “Amazing Japanese Boys Who Captured a Small UFO in 1972,” and published on his site, otakupapa.net.</p><p>The story as told by Otakupapa begins with a report by eighth grade middle school student Michio Seo that at around sunset on August 25, 1972, he had seen a small, strange object flying around a rice field. According to him, it would move instantly from one position to another as if it were teleporting.</p><p><a href="https://podcastufo.com/a-ufo-captured-by-children-in-japan/#more-3026" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

The creatures were described as having brown heads with pinky-sized, horizontal wrinkles where a face would be; three silver, metallic, two-inch fang-like features where a mouth would be; and two rabbit-like ears with a hole in the middle of each one. One of the creatures confronted the boys and emitted a noise like a sped-up tape recorder in what seemed to be an attempt to communicate. They ran away to Kono’s home where their parents were having dinner and they excitedly told their story. Kono’s mother thought they had made it up as an excuse for being late, but the boys insisted it was true and pleaded with their mothers to go with them and see for themselves.

They were taken seriously, and an investigation revealed not only other witnesses, but also physical evidence to back up their story. The case was re-examined almost 40 years later by investigators from the Space Phenomena Observatory Center, and in their opinion, still holds up. A report was given to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization and the Center for UFO Studies by Matsushito Hayashi of the Japan Space Phenomena Association.

According to the version of events in one of Otakupapa’s sources (Kubota, Hachiro UFO to Uchu (UFOs &amp; Space) June 1975, NO.12, 8-17, Universe Publishing Co.), the lights were seen by the boys to be orange objects as they got closer.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When a nine-year-old boy in Harrah, Washington, approximately 12 miles west of the city of Toppenish, told his mother a story about seeing strange creatures and their vehicles on the morning of a school day, she heard him out, and then sent him to school. His story would likely have gone no further, had it not been for a teacher’s aide who went with him back to his house during recess after hearing his story and believing him. This lead to the discovery of physical traces that backed up his story and an investigation by members of the Center for UFO Studies and a reporter from a local paper.</p><p>According to the article “Harrah Youth Reports UFOs With ‘Greenish Creatures,’” written by Frances Story and published in the January 26, 1977 <a href="https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/United%20States/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service/UFO%20Newsclipping%20Service%20-%201977%2002-03%20-%20no%2094-95.pdf" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">Toppenish Review</a>, nine-year-old Jose Cantu woke his mother up at 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 19, wanting her to explain a “little man” he’d seen outside. His mother, Martha, had had a rough night with her baby and sent him away so she could get some more sleep. Jose then went out to investigate on his own.</p><p>Jose came back in and told his mother what he’d seen. According to him, there were two greenish creatures in the yard that were about three feet tall, and instead of having feet, they rotated on round bases. He said he saw two “steely” craft, one sitting in the yard and one on a flat section of the roof, and that there was a creature in each one. He said he observed all this while hiding behind a washing machine outside next to a shed.</p><p>As he watched, the two creatures in the yard returned to the vehicles. He said they had “straight stairs” leading to doors that opened “in two parts, like a cross,” and that there were two chairs with tall bases inside. The vehicles then rose up and disappeared into some sort of vaporous cloud. <a href="https://podcastufo.com/ufos-and-strange-creatures-in-harrah-washington/#more-2801" style="color:rgb(99,46,155);">Read more →</a></p>]]></description>

Most of us here in the United States got the news from <a href="http://inexplicata.blogspot.com/2022/02/argentina-residents-of-victorica.html" style="color:rgb(29,155,219);">INEXPLICATA-The Journal of Hispanic UFOlogy</a>. A recent post on the site on February 6 tells of another report out of La Pampa that is just as strange�The sources are listed as Luis Burgos and the online La Pampa news publication InfoHuella.

On February 4, a couple and their adult son were travelling by truck on their way home to the town of Victoria. They were crossing the border between La Pampa province and San Luis province to the east. As they passed under the border arch they saw “many lights.” According to one of the witnesses, “When we saw the lights, the first thing we wondered was if it had to do with Victorica Agricultural School being lit up. We then realized this could not be the case, as we were far away.” Before they could make sense of what they were seeing, they found themselves entering the town of Victorica, 26 kilometers from where they were a moment ago.
